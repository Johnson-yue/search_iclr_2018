Anonymous authors Paper under double-blind review
ABSTRACT
Somatic mutation calling at ultra low allele frequencies is an unmet challenge that is intractable with current state-of-the-art mutation calling methods. The ability to detect cancer associated mutations in ultra low allele frequency is a fundamental requirement for cancer early detection, monitoring, and therapy nomination using liquid biopsy methods (cell-free DNA). Here we defined a spatial representation of sequencing information adapted to be used in a convolutional architecture that enables variant detection at allele frequencies of 10×-5. This is 2 orders of magnitude below the current state of the art. We validated our method on both simulated plasma and on clinical plasma samples from cancer patients and healthy controls. This method introduces a new domain within bioinformatics and personalized medicine, somatic whole genome mutation calling for liquid biopsies.
1 INTRODUCTION
The cancer genome acquires somatic mutations which drive its proliferative capacity (Lawrence et al., 2014). Mutations in the cancer genome also provide critical information regarding the evolutionary history and mutational processes active in each cancer (Martincorena et al., 2017; Alexandrov et al., 2013). Cancer mutation calling in patient biopsies have become a pivotal step in evaluating patient outcome and therapeutic nomination. Identifying cancer driver mutations in liquid biopsy samples, such as cell-free circulating DNA (cfDNA), has been suggested as a transformative platform for early-stage cancer screening.
Cell-free circulating DNA released from dying cells enables surveys of the somatic genome and epigenome dynamically over time for clinical purposes. The ability to obtain a biopsy through a simple blood draws allows for dynamic genomic measurement in a non-invasive manner. It can overcome spatial limitations, such as inaccessibility of lung tissue. Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), not to be confused with cell-free DNA, can be found and measured in the blood of cancer patients (cfDNA). ctDNA was shown to correlate with tumor burden and change in response to treatment or surgery (Diehl et al., 2008). ctDNA can be detected even in early stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and therefore has the potential to transform NSCLC diagnosis and treatment (Sozzi et al., 2003; Tie et al., 2016; Bettegowda et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2010). Nevertheless, the fraction of tumor-derived DNA fragments in total cfDNA is usually exceedingly low, especially in the context of early detection or after therapeutic intervention when the tumor burden is low. While the detection of cancer with low tumor burden is of significant clinical benefit, it challenges our current methods for identifying somatic mutations due to the low tumor-derived cfDNA frequency.
The most common type of somatic mutations are single-nucleotide variants (SNVs), which occur at a frequency of 1-100/Mbp (Megabase pair). These variants are typically identified in shot gun sequencing data through a careful comparison of the DNA sequencing reads which map to a particular locus in the cancer sample and the germline normal DNA sample. This complex process has been enabled through tools of ever-increasing sophistication that refine the statistical comparison between the number of supporting reads with the variant in the cancer and germline sample (Cibulskis et al., 2013; Saunders et al., 2012; Wilm et al., 2012).
These statistical methods require multiple independent observations (supporting reads) of the somatic variant at any genomic location to distinguish true mutations from sequencing errors. This

can be readily achieved through increasing depth of sequencing 1 as long as the tumor sample contains a high proportion of tumor cells. When the tumor cell content in the sample drops, for example due to the presence of normal cells such as immune cells in the sample, each somatic variant is no longer supported by multiple reads, precluding the use of these mutation callers. Mutect for example is the current state-of-the-art low-allele frequency somatic mutation caller. At its core, Mutect subjects a SNV to two Bayesian classifiers, one assumes that the SNV results from random noise and the other that the site contains a true variant. It then filters a SNV based on a log-likelihood ratio from the two models. This is fundamentally different than the cfDNA setting.
In a benchmarking setting when the mutation allele frequency drops to .05 and the tumor sample sequencing depth goes down to 10X, Mutect's sensitivity decreases to below 0.1 (Cibulskis et al., 2013). While Mutect is currently the state-of-the art somatic mutation caller in low-frequency settings, it is still unable to identify somatic mutations in tumor fractions like those observed in cfDNA. Thus, we require a fundamental rethinking of mutation detection algorithms to identify somatic mutations in cfDNA.
We need novel methodology that would enable an accurate distinction of true somatic cancer mutations from sequencing errors, even in low tumor fractions that preclude the presence of multiple independent observations in any given genomic location. To do so, we have developed a classifier trained to discriminate between systemic errors and somatic mutations caused by tobacco induced lung cancer. We take advantage of the fact that both cancer mutations and sequencing errors are systemic and governed by distinct signatures that can be learned and used for efficient signal to noise discrimination. One of the major sources of such signature is the genomic context in which the substitutions occur. It is well described that cancer associated mutagenesis processes such as exposure to Tobacco and UV light are characterized by a unique signature of genomic contexts in which these mutations occur (Alexandrov et al., 2013).
We simulated plasma somatic mutation calling using synthetic mixtures of tumor and normal wholegenome-sequencing data from lung patients with variable fraction of tumor reads ranging from 1% to 0.001% (1/10,000). To benchmark our detection performance we first characterize the patientspecific somatic cancer SNVs by doing standard mutation calling on the patient's pure tumor and normal samples. We then detect cancer mutations in the plasma samples using several methods, including our convolutional network. We characterize the sensitivity and precision of each method using pure tumor mutation calling as a reference, demonstrating signal and noise detection for each method. Finally, the same process was validated on cfDNA samples from patients with early stage lung cancer showing significant superior sensitivity and precision in compare to current state-of-theart methods.
1.1 DNA SEQUENCING AND ALIGNMENT
Cancer mutation detection relies on a sequencing method that utilizes shotgun sequencing. The DNA is cut up into short fragments that are then sequenced in high throughput, using an optical method that provides the nucleotide identity at each position on the DNA fragment. During sequencing, the input DNA fragment is used as a template to synthesize a complementary strand of DNA from synthetic photoactive nucleotides. While these sequencing methods achieve high accuracy, errors occur at an average error rate of approximately 2.1 errors per kilobasepair (kbp) sequenced (Schirmer et al., 2016).
The sequencing process also provides an estimate of the confidence of the sequencing quality at each base, known as the base quality score. Previous studies have demonstrated that Illumina sequencing errors are not random and are likely related to both DNA sequence context and technical factors consequential of the sequencing technologies (Nakamura et al., 2011). The fidelity of sequencing is also limited by the length of each sequencing read, with an increase in error rate as the read length increases.
After sequencing, reads are then mapped to a reference genome. This process is computationally intensive and complicated by the fact that the genome has variable regions, motifs, and repeatable elements. Short 50150 nucleotide reads may map to more than one location or not map at all. This
1e.g., 50X, whereby each location in the genome is covered on average with 50 independent observations reads

process may be an additional source of error, as a variant compared to the germline DNA may be the result of mismapping the read to the wrong location. Therefore, the aligners also provide a confidence estimate regarding the accuracy of the mapping for each read, known as mapping quality.
We identify multiple sources of information that can suggest that the variant detected is not the result of a true somatic mutations, such as i) low base quality, ii) low mapping quality, iii) position in the read closer to its end and iv) the sequence context. While specific sequence contexts are associated with higher probability of sequencing errors (Chen et al., 2017), true mutations often affect specific sequence contexts. For example, tobacco related mutations tend to occur at CC contexts, and mutations related to the activity of APOBEC enzyme prefer the TpC context for inserting somatic mutations. Thus, sequence context can help identify changes that are more likely to result from sequencing artifacts as well as changes more likely to result from prevalent mutational processes.
2 RESULTS
When designing a model for somatic mutation classification, it is important to recognize the sources of error that may lead to false positive somatic mutations. A true mutation is likely to have a high base quality regardless of position in the read. Similarly, the read base, reference base, and alignment string (CIGAR) at the position of a true mutation are likely to be independent of the reads alignment. More specifically, we can expect a true somatic mutation to be spatially invariant. It is well known that systemic errors in sequencing experiments are dependent on the position in the read, so while the mutation itself may be spatially invariant, its position in the read is not. Errors caused by mismapping will be likely to contain repetitive sequence or very specific sequence motifs (such TTAGGG in the telomeres). Our model must be able to accurately represent both the spatial invariance in true somatic mutations and in errors due to mapping, while simultaneously maintaining a model of base quality across the read.
It follows that any shallow convolutional network that depends on a fully connected layer over the read of interest to make classifications would be unable to capture the invariance in the mutations. We elected for a 8-layer convolutional neural network with a single fully connected layer at the end inspired by the VGG architecture to correct for this spatial dependency (Simonyan & Zisserman, 2014). Building off of the results in Alexandrov et al. (2013) that tri-nucleotide contexts contain distinct signatures involved in mutagenesis, we convolve over all features (columns) at a position using a perceptive field of size three. After two successive convolutional layers, we apply down sampling by maxpooling with a receptive field of two and a stride of two, forcing our model to retain only the most important features in small spatial areas (Boureau et al., 2010). We propose two benefits from this architecture: 1) we maintain spatial invariance when convolving over trinucleotide windows and 2) we can capture a 'quality map' by collapsing the read fragment into 25 segments, each representing approximately an eight-nucleotide region. The output of the last convolutional layer is applied directly to a sigmoid fully connected layer used to make the final classification. We use a simple logistic regression layer instead of a multi-layer perceptron or global average pooling in order to retain the features associated with position in the read.
We deem our model and training scheme, Kittyhawk. Kittyhawk is the first use of a read representation that jointly captures the genomic context of alignment, the complete read sequence, and the integration of the quality score per base. Other works have used similar representations but these consider piles of reads as single features, losing information valuable about the sequence alignment itself and the per-base quality associated with a read (Poplin et al., 2016; Torracinta & Campagne, 2016). The performance of Kittyhawk shows that integrating features across a read and its alignment has set the stage for a new set of somatic mutation callers using the full mutational profile of a sample, rather than just those which are covered with high depth. Capturing mutations at such a sensitive level with a simple measurement tool enables a new way to look at prognosis and therapeutic treatment.

We find that while the model manages an average F1-score on the validation set of .961. As expected, our model achieves a n F1-score of .71 on the Tumor control. We observe that while the model is still sensitive on the tumor control, it unsurprising loses a large fraction of specificity compared to the validation dataset. However, in the case of our independent lung sample, we observe a F1 of .92, which high specificity (Table 1). The low precision and specificity in the cancer control indicates that kittyhawk has learned specific mutation patterns associated with tobacco smoking lung cancer, while learning a more general error pattern.

2.2 KITTYHAWK IS SENSITIVE AND PRECISE AT LOW TUMOR FRACTIONS IN SYNTHETIC
PLASMAS
To evaluate the performance of our method in low tumor fraction settings, we compare precision and sensitivity to the state of the art caller, Mutect, to the simple calling method, pileup, and to the filters we apply before using kittyhawk. We also introduce another metric, called enrichment, which informs us of the increase in ratio of tumor to normal mutations when implying a filter (Equation 5).

enrichment = P recisionout P recisionin

(5)

We can see that pileup has sufficient sensitivity to detect somatic mutations in simulated plasmas, as by definition all mutations are included (Figure 2.2. However, this reflects poorly in the enrichment and precision metrics. The next stage of our pipeline filters by mutation frequency. While the MF and BQMQ filters actually deplete the sample of tumor reads, we do see an expected increase in enrichment when TF=0.01. This is a good indication that the filter is useful both for our evaluation pipeline but also for removing a large portion of the noise before presenting it to our CNN. When we apply the CNN filter and observe an additional (third) order of magnitude decrease in noise. Most importantly, the decrease in sensitivity is only about 25%. With the completely pipeline we achieve an enrichment of 12x in tumor fraction 0.01, and an enrichment of 1.12 in tumor fraction 0.0001 (Figure 2.2).

As expected, Mutect alone on the synthetic plasmas is unable to detect more than two mutations in the synthetic samples at any tumor fraction, and anytime it successfully makes a mutation prediction, it makes the same call in tumor fraction = 0. Kittyhawk increases sensitivity over Mutect 200 fold

2.3 KITTYHAWK ENABLES SOMATIC MUTATION CALLING IN REAL CFDNA SAMPLES
To check that our method is robust to the actual clinical setting, we evaluate it on two samples. One is a cfDNA sample from a healthy individual (BB600), the other is from an early stage lung cancer patient, taken before surgery (BB1125). While in the actual clinic, we have no access to mutational information about patients. However, since BB1125 underwent surgery, we are able to measure the

true somatic mutations using the standard mutation calling pipeline. We can use these calls and intersect them with the reads taken from cfDNA to get an estimate again of Kittyhawk's sensitivity, precision, and enrichment.
We find that after applying our filtering pipeline, we are able to capture 27 of the 413 mutations present in the sample. Most strikingly, we observe suppress false positives in the control from 266 errors present to 3 errors (Table 2. While kittyhawk enriches the sample it is presented with for tumor DNA as expected, the pipeline as a whole actually depletes the tumor signal by about 50%. We suspect differences in the preprocessing steps have led to a poor setting for the BQMQ filter. We suspect that the base quality score of 20 may be too lenient for this sample.
3 METHODS
3.1 TRAINING DATASET SELECTION
We aim to use a training scheme that allows us to both detect true somatic mutations with high sensitivity and reject candidate mutations caused by systemic errors. To achieve this goal, we sample a variety of lung cancer patients and their matching systemic error profiles. Four samples were selected from a variety of tobacco-smoking lung cancer patients for training. (Table 3). An additional tobacco-smoking lung cancer patient was held out for testing. The samples were processed and provided by the Cancer Alliance at the New York Genome Center (appendix figure). These samples have a complete tumor sample and a healthy tissue sample from the same patient. We take the con-

sensus of the three callers, Strelka, LoFreq, and Mutect (Saunders et al., 2012; Wilm et al., 2012; Cibulskis et al., 2013) to make a final calls of somatic mutations. We then use the reads supporting these mutations as our tumor reads for training.
Since we would like our model to learn to discriminate against sequencing artifacts, we then collect reads from the healthy sample that containing mutations that occur exactly once. Since these variants are not supported by more than one read, we can say with high certainty that they are due to systemic errors. We then filter variants which are low quality. We filter reads with a base quality score at the mutation less than twenty or with a mapping quality less than forty (BQ ¡ 20, MAPQ ¡ 40). We determined these thresholds by inspection and allowed some room for lower quality samples to be included in training. We additionally set aside small subsets of our training set to be used as a validation dataset. This dataset is used to both monitor training progress and to verify our models performance on independent reads (but not independent mutations). We then evaluate our models performance on the test lung dataset.

3.2 SYNTHETIC PLASMAS

In order to test our methods ability to detect somatic mutations at low frequency, we generated four

simulated plasma samples from our test lung sample (CA0044, Table 3) by sampling randomly from

the patient's healthy DNA and from the patient's tumor DNA. Sampling was performed with cov-

erage of 35 and with tumor mixtures at 0%, 0.01%, 0.001%, and 0.0001%. Mixing was performed

with three random seeds for robustness. We assume that somatic mutations will be occurring in

cfDNA at a rate below 0.1. Therefore, when preparing our synthetic plasma reads for inference, we

To evaluate the performance of our method in low tumor fraction settings, we compare precision, sensitivity, and enrichment, to the state of the art low frequency caller, Mutect. We also compare to a simple calling method called Pileup which allows for any observed mismatch (Li et al., 2009). After pileup, we repeatedly apply the same filters used for kittyhawk and measure our performance at each step. The filters are, MF (mutation frequency), which filters pileup reads that occur more frequently than we expect to see in plasma (mutation occurs ¡ 10% of the time), BQMQ, which filters reads that have a base quality at the mutation below 20 or a mapping quality below 40, and finally our filtration method, Kittyhawk.

3.3 EVALUATION OF CFDNA SAMPLES
After evaluating Kittyhawk on synthetic samples we looked to test its performance on real plasma DNA samples. We used a single control (BB600) and a tobacco smoking lung cancer patient (BB1125). Since we have the tumor biopsy also performed on these patients, we measure the true positives by assuming all Mutect called mutations from the biopsy that are also present in the cfDNA to be true mutations. Using these calls we then perform the same analysis as in the synthetic plasmas. Evaluating the sensitivity, precision, and enrichment. In the case of our control, we perform all measurements against the mutations for BB1125.

3.4 FEATURE CONSTRUCTION
To fully capture the sequencing read, alignment, and genomic context, we create a spatially-oriented representation of a read (Figure 4). The first five rows represent the reference context (i.e, the

7

sequence in the human genome), the next five rows represent the read sequence (base pairs in the read), rows 11-15 represent the alignment string (CIGAR), and the final row represents the quality score at each position in the read. Each column represents an indicator vector referring to the presence or absence of a specific base. The read, genomic context, and CIGAR rows are mutually exclusive, such as in a one-hot encoding.

Genomic Context

Figure 4: Top: Representation of a read and its alignment as seen by kittyhawk, Bottom: Genomic context is appended to the ends of the read. Zeroes are padded for non-context features.
For insertions in the reference, an "N" is placed in the reference context at the location of the insertion to maintain a spatial alignment. For deletions in the reference, an "N" is placed in the read sequence at the location of the deletion. Softmasked regions are segmented such that the read is adjacent to the mapped portion of the read and the reference context is broken with consecutive "N's" until the end of the softmasked region. This is done for two reasons, to ensure the signal for softmasked regions is strong and secondly to maintain the idea of a read being independent from its alignment.
We then pad +- 25 bp from the genomic context to both sides of the read (Figure 4). This results in a 16x200bp matrix for 150bp reads, in the case where a read is not 150bp, extra context bases are added. We set the maximum base quality score at 40 (p = 99.99%) and scale the scores to be in the interval [0, 1]. Bases not covered by a read (genomic context) receive a base quality score of zero. Deletions in the read receive a quality score that is the mean of the two flanking positions on the read.
3.5 HYPER-PARAMETERS AND IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS
We trained our model using minibatch stochastic gradient decent with an initial learning rate  = .1 and momentum  = .9. The learning rate was decreased by a factor of 10 when the validation loss reached a plateau as in He et al. (2016). We used a minibatch size of 256 as it seemed to provide the best trade off between validation loss and training speed. We elected to use a base of 64 filters, doubling after each down sampling layer to maintain a consistent number of parameters

at each stage. This was chosen empirically after observing the inability of a 32-base filter model to perform sufficiently. After each convolutional layer apply batch normalization (Ioffe & Szegedy, 2015) followed by a rectified linear unit (Nair & Hinton, 2010). Before each pooling layer, we apply dropout with a drop probability = .5 (Srivastava et al., 2014).
4 DISCUSSION
While unsurprisingly Kittyhawk showed strong performance in the balanced tumor fraction setting, it maintained a large portion of its performance even in the simulated plasmas. Kittyhawk also achieved an enrichment of 2 fold in tumor fraction of 0.0001, suggesting the ability to capture relevant somatic mutations even when they are 10 times more rare than sequencing noise itself. Mutect, a tool intentionally not designed to function in the cfDNA setting, makes less than two predictions in all tumor fractions.
The next step in moving toward a complete early-detection engine is to improve the performance on real cfDNA samples. While Kittyhawk captures position in the read by using a fully connected sigmoid layer, there are architectures which may be more suited for capturing relative position on the read. Additionally we have excluded an extra source of information contained in the read-pair that comes from the DNA fragment. The read pair can be used to determine both the strand of origin (Watson or Crick) and to estimate the DNA fragment size. It has been observed that ctDNA have a distinct fragment size distribution compared to regular circulating healthy DNA (Underhill et al., 2016). It has been shown that RNN's (recurrent neural network) are a powerful tool for using length as a feature in bioinformatics at distances even up to 1kb, far beyond the size of a ctDNA fragment (Hill et al., 2017). These results suggest that integrating a recurrent neural network instead of a logistic regression layer could increase performance even further.
Kittyhawk is the first somatic mutation caller designed to function in the low allele frequency setting, such as liquid biopsy for early stage cancer detection. We apply a novel representation of a read along with a hand-engineered architecture to best capture the expected features associated with a read and its alignment. This work sets the stage for a new family of somatic mutation callers to aid detection in liquid biopsy, paving the way for pivotal non-invasive prognosis and therapeutic nomination.
