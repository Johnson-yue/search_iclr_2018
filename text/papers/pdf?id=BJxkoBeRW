Anonymous authors Paper under double-blind review
ABSTRACT
The abstract paragraph should be indented 1/2 inch (3 picas) on both left and righthand margins. Use 10 point type, with a vertical spacing of 11 points. The word ABSTRACT must be centered, in small caps, and in point size 12. Two line spaces precede the abstract. The abstract must be limited to one paragraph.
1 SUBMISSION OF CONFERENCE PAPERS TO ICLR 2018
ICLR requires electronic submissions, processed by https://openreview.net/. See ICLR's website for more instructions. If your paper is ultimately accepted, the statement \iclrfinalcopy should be inserted to adjust the format to the camera ready requirements. The format for the submissions is a variant of the NIPS format. Please read carefully the instructions below, and follow them faithfully.
1.1 STYLE Papers to be submitted to ICLR 2018 must be prepared according to the instructions presented here. Authors are required to use the ICLR LATEX style files obtainable at the ICLR website. Please make sure you use the current files and not previous versions. Tweaking the style files may be grounds for rejection.
1.2 RETRIEVAL OF STYLE FILES The style files for ICLR and other conference information are available on the World Wide Web at
http://www.iclr.cc/
The file iclr2018_conference.pdf contains these instructions and illustrates the various formatting requirements your ICLR paper must satisfy. Submissions must be made using LATEX and the style files iclr2018_conference.sty and iclr2018_conference.bst (to be used with LATEX2e). The file iclr2018_conference.tex may be used as a "shell" for writing your paper. All you have to do is replace the author, title, abstract, and text of the paper with your own. The formatting instructions contained in these style files are summarized in sections 2, 3, and 4 below.
2 GENERAL FORMATTING INSTRUCTIONS
The text must be confined within a rectangle 5.5 inches (33 picas) wide and 9 inches (54 picas) long. The left margin is 1.5 inch (9 picas). Use 10 point type with a vertical spacing of 11 points. Times New Roman is the preferred typeface throughout. Paragraphs are separated by 1/2 line space, with no indentation. Paper title is 17 point, in small caps and left-aligned. All pages should start at 1 inch (6 picas) from the top of the page.

Authors' names are set in boldface, and each name is placed above its corresponding address. The lead author's name is to be listed first, and the co-authors' names are set to follow. Authors sharing the same address can be on the same line. Please pay special attention to the instructions in section 4 regarding figures, tables, acknowledgments, and references.
3 HEADINGS: FIRST LEVEL
First level headings are in small caps, flush left and in point size 12. One line space before the first level heading and 1/2 line space after the first level heading.
3.1 HEADINGS: SECOND LEVEL
Second level headings are in small caps, flush left and in point size 10. One line space before the second level heading and 1/2 line space after the second level heading.
3.1.1 HEADINGS: THIRD LEVEL Third level headings are in small caps, flush left and in point size 10. One line space before the third level heading and 1/2 line space after the third level heading.
4 CITATIONS, FIGURES, TABLES, REFERENCES
These instructions apply to everyone, regardless of the formatter being used.
4.1 CITATIONS WITHIN THE TEXT
Citations within the text should be based on the natbib package and include the authors' last names and year (with the "et al." construct for more than two authors). When the authors or the publication are included in the sentence, the citation should not be in parenthesis (as in "See Hinton et al. (2006) for more information."). Otherwise, the citation should be in parenthesis (as in "Deep learning shows promise to make progress towards AI (Bengio & LeCun, 2007)."). The corresponding references are to be listed in alphabetical order of authors, in the REFERENCES section. As to the format of the references themselves, any style is acceptable as long as it is used consistently.
4.2 FOOTNOTES Indicate footnotes with a number1 in the text. Place the footnotes at the bottom of the page on which they appear. Precede the footnote with a horizontal rule of 2 inches (12 picas).2
4.3 FIGURES
All artwork must be neat, clean, and legible. Lines should be dark enough for purposes of reproduction; art work should not be hand-drawn. The figure number and caption always appear after the figure. Place one line space before the figure caption, and one line space after the figure. The figure caption is lower case (except for first word and proper nouns); figures are numbered consecutively. Make sure the figure caption does not get separated from the figure. Leave sufficient space to avoid splitting the figure and figure caption. You may use color figures. However, it is best for the figure captions and the paper body to make sense if the paper is printed either in black/white or in color.

4.4 TABLES
All tables must be centered, neat, clean and legible. Do not use hand-drawn tables. The table number and title always appear before the table. See Table 1. Place one line space before the table title, one line space after the table title, and one line space after the table. The table title must be lower case (except for first word and proper nouns); tables are numbered consecutively.
5 FINAL INSTRUCTIONS
Do not change any aspects of the formatting parameters in the style files. In particular, do not modify the width or length of the rectangle the text should fit into, and do not change font sizes (except perhaps in the REFERENCES section; see below). Please note that pages should be numbered.
6 PREPARING POSTSCRIPT OR PDF FILES
Please prepare PostScript or PDF files with paper size "US Letter", and not, for example, "A4". The -t letter option on dvips will produce US Letter files. Consider directly generating PDF files using pdflatex (especially if you are a MiKTeX user). PDF figures must be substituted for EPS figures, however. Otherwise, please generate your PostScript and PDF files with the following commands:
dvips mypaper.dvi -t letter -Ppdf -G0 -o mypaper.ps ps2pdf mypaper.ps mypaper.pdf
6.1 MARGINS IN LATEX
Most of the margin problems come from figures positioned by hand using \special or other commands. We suggest using the command \includegraphics from the graphicx package. Always specify the figure width as a multiple of the line width as in the example below using .eps graphics

\usepackage[dvips]{graphicx} ... \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{myfile.eps} or \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx} ... \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{myfile.pdf} for .pdf graphics. See section 4.4 in the graphics bundle documentation (http://www.ctan. org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/graphics/grfguide.ps) A number of width problems arise when LaTeX cannot properly hyphenate a line. Please give LaTeX hyphenation hints using the \- command. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS Use unnumbered third level headings for the acknowledgments. All acknowledgments, including those to funding agencies, go at the end of the paper.
