The paper is very easy to follow. and the proofs are clearly written. The theorems provide exponential gaps for very simple polynomial functions.\n\n-ves:\n1. My main concern with the paper is the novelty of the contribution to the techniques. The results in the paper are more general than that of Lin et al., but the proofs are basically the same, and it's difficult to see the contribution of this paper in terms of the contributing fundamentally new ideas. \n2. The second concern is that the results apply only to non-linear activation functions with sufficiently many non-zero derivatives (same requirements as for the results of Lin et al.).\n3. Finally, in prop 3.3, reducing from uniform approximations to Taylor approximations, the inequality |E(δx)| <= δ^(d+1) |N(x) - p(x)| does not follow from the definition of a Taylor approximation.\n\nDespite these criticisms, I contend that the significance of the problem, and the clean and understandable results in the paper make it a decent paper for ICLR.","confidence":"4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"The power of deeper networks for expressing natural functions","abstract":"It is well-known that neural networks are universal approximators, but that deeper networks tend in practice to be more powerful than shallower ones.

","rating":"6: Marginally above acceptance threshold","review":"The paper investigates the representation of polynomials by neural networks up to a certain degree and implied uniform approximations. It shows exponential gaps between the width of shallow and deep networks required for approximating a given sparse polynomial. \n\nBy focusing on polynomials, the paper is able to use of a variety of tools (e.g. linear algebra) to investigate the representation question. Results such as Proposition 3.3 relate the representation of a polynomial up to a certain degree, to the approximation question. Here it would be good to be more specific about the domain, however, as approximating the low order terms certainly does not guarantee a global uniform approximation. \n\nTheorem 3.4 makes an interesting claim, that a finite network size is sufficient to achieve the best possible approximation of a polynomial (the proof building on previous results, e.g. by Lin et al that I did not verify). The idea being to construct a superposition of Taylor approximations of the individual monomials. Here it would be good to be more specific about the domain. Also, in the discussion of Taylor series, it would be good to mention the point around which the series is developed, e.g. the origin. \n\nThe paper mentions that ``the theorem is false for rectified linear units (ReLUs), which are piecewise linear and do not admit a Taylor series''. However, a ReLU can also be approximated by a smooth function and a Taylor series. \n\nTheorem 4.1 seems to be implied by Theorem 4.2. Similarly, parts of Section 4.2 seem to follow directly from the previous discussion. \n\nIn page 1 ```existence proofs' without explicit constructions'' This is not true, with numerous papers providing explicit constructions of functions that are representable by neural networks with specific types of activation functions. \n\n","confidence":"4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"The power of deeper networks for expressing natural functions","abstract":"It is well-known that neural networks are universal approximators, but that deeper networks tend in practice to be more powerful than shallower ones.

The paper also has bounds for neural networks of a specified depth k (Theorem 5.1), and the authors conjecture this bound to be tight (Conjecture 5.2). \n\nThis is an interesting result, and is an improvement over Lin 2017 (where a similar bound is presented for monomial approximation). \nOverall, I like the paper.\n\nPros: new and interesting result, theoretically sound. \nCons: nothing major.\nComments and clarifications:\n* What about the ability of a single neural network to approximate a class of functions (instead of a single p), where the topology is fixed but the network weights are allowed to vary? Could you comment on this problem?\n* Is the assumption that \\sigma has Taylor expansion to order d tight? (That is, are there counter examples for relaxations of this assumption?) \n* As noted, the assumptions of your theorems 4.1-4.3 do not apply to ReLUs, but ReLUs network perform well in practice. Could you provide some further comments on this?\n\n","confidence":"4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"The power of deeper networks for expressing natural functions","abstract":"It is well-known that neural networks are universal approximators, but that deeper networks tend in practice to be more powerful than shallower ones.
