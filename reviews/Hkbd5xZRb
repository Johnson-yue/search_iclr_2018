The goal is to detect patterns in spherical signals irrespective of how they are rotated on the sphere.  The key is to make the convolutional architecture rotation equivariant.\n\nPros:\n\n+ novel/original proposal justified both theoretically and empirically\n+ well written, easy to follow\n+ limited evaluation on a classification and regression task is suggestive of the proposed approach's potential\n+ efficient implementation\n\nCons:\n\n- related work, in particular the first paragraph, should compare and contrast with the closest extant work rather than merely list them\n- evaluation is limited; granted this is the nature of the target domain\n\nPresentation:\n\nWhile the paper is generally written well, the paper appears to conflate the definition of the convolutional and correlation operators?  This point should be clarified in a revised manuscript.  \n\nIn Section 5 (Experiments), there are several references to S^2CNN.  This naming of the proposed approach should be made clear earlier in the manuscript.  As an aside, this appears a little confusing since convolution is performed first on S^2 and then SO(3). \n\nEvaluation:\n\nWhat are the timings of the forward/backward pass and space considerations for the Spherical ConvNets presented in the evaluation section?  Please provide specific numbers for the various tasks presented.\n\nHow many layers (parameters) are used in the baselines in Table 2?  If indeed there are much less parameters used in the proposed approach, this would strengthen the argument for the approach.  On the other hand, was there an attempt to add additional layers to the proposed approach for the shape recognition experiment in Sec. 5.3 to improve performance?\n\nMinor Points:\n\n- some references are missing their source, e.g., Maslen 1998 and Kostolec, Rockmore, 2007, and Ravanbakhsh, et al. 2016.\n\n- some sources for the references are presented inconsistency, e.g., Cohen and Welling, 2017 and Dieleman, et al. 2017\n\n- some references include the first name of the authors, others use the initial \n\n- in references to et al. or not, appears inconsistent\n\n- Eqns 4, 5, 6, and 8 require punctuation\n\n- Section 4 line 2, period missing before \"Since the FFT\"\n\n- \"coulomb matrix\" --> \"Coulomb matrix\"\n\n- Figure 5, caption: \"The red dot correcpond to\" --> \"The red dot corresponds to\"\n\nFinal remarks:\n\nBased on the novelty of the approach, and the sufficient evaluation, I recommend the paper be accepted.\n\n","confidence":"4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Spherical CNNs","abstract":"Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have become the method of choice for learning problems involving 2D planar images.
