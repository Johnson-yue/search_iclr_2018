","rating":"3: Clear rejection","review":"OVERVIEW: The authors present results from several state-of-the-art generative models trained on a facial dataset for learning a general facial identity space. \n\nSTRENGTHS: The paper in general is well written and easy to ready. I appreciate the idea of the Turing test and qualitative results presented are quite impressive. Also, the use of  diverse state-of-the-art generative models is also a strong point.  \n\nWEAKNESSES: While the strengths mentioned above are obvious I had the impression through the whole paper that a whole part is missing. My list of concerns are the following: \n\n    The authors state as their first contribution the presentation of a novel dataset. This is nice but I see the data is actually already available as the photographic work of an artist. So what's the authors' contribution? As I understand from the paper it is just compiling this already available data.\n    The major problem of this paper in my opinion is the total lack of technical details. In this sense the results cannot by any means by reproduced. While the authors use a set of very novel generative models there is absolutely no detail on how do they train them. We are just shown some very impressive qualitative results which are indeed admirable but without further details I cannot judge them as true or not. I strongly recommend to the authors, to provide technical details of topologies used, hyper parameters and any other important detail that would help a third party research to reproduce these results. \n    Also it is really hard to understand how could they obtain such impressive result by doing an unsupervised training on a dataset containing 3353 samples taking into account the high capacity of the models they are using. \n    In section 2.1 the authors mention that facial landmarks have been detected using a 'pre-trained ensemble-of-regresion-trees detector (Gerbrands, 1981)'. I know very well the facial alignment literature and I do not understand this reference. This I do not think is a reference to a facial alignment method bu t rather a set of general purpose linear algebra methods. \n\nTaking into account this major weaknesses I cannot accept this paper and I do not think it is worth discussing results and applications in Sections 3,4,5 before authors detail, explain and clarify how exactly they have obtained these results.
