The general idea is interesting and the results show improvements over previous approaches, such as CycleGAN (with different initializations, pre-learned or not). The algorithm is tested on three datasets.\n\nWhile the approach has some strong positive points, such as good experiments and theoretical insights (the idea to match by synthesis and the proposed loss which is novel, and combines the proposed concepts), the paper lacks clarity and sufficient details.\n\nInstead of the longer intro and related work discussion, I would prefer to see a Figure with the architecture and more illustrative examples to show that the insights are reflected in the experiments. Also, the matching part, which is discussed at the theoretical level, could be better explained and presented at a more visual level. It is hard to understand sufficiently well what the formalism means without more insight.\n\nAlso, the experiments need more details. For example, it is not clear what the numbers in Table 2 mean.\n\n\n\n","confidence":"4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Identifying Analogies Across Domains","abstract":"Identifying analogies across domains without supervision is a key task for artificial intelligence.

The contribution is the addition of an explicit exemplar constraint into the formulation which allows best matches from the other domain to be retrieved. The results show that the proposed method is superior for the task of exact correspondence identification and that AN-GAN rivals the performance of pix2pix with strong supervision.\n\n\nNegatives:\n1.) The task of exact correspondence identification seems contrived. It is not clear which real-world problems have this property of having both all inputs and all outputs in the dataset, with just the correspondence information between inputs and outputs missing.\n2.) The supervised vs unsupervised experiment on Facades->Labels (Table 3) is only one scenario where applying a supervised method on top of AN-GAN’s matches is better than an unsupervised method.  More transfer experiments of this kind would greatly benefit the paper and support the conclusion that “our self-supervised method performs similarly to the fully supervised method.” \n\nPositives:\n1.) The paper does a good job motivating the need for an explicit image matching term inside a GAN framework\n2.) The paper shows promising results on applying a supervised method on top of AN-GAN’s matches.\n\nMinor comments:\n1. The paper sometimes uses L1 and sometimes L_1, it should be L_1 in all cases.\n2. DiscoGAN should have the Kim et al citation, right after the first time it is used. I had to look up DiscoGAN to realize it is just Kim et al.","confidence":"4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Identifying Analogies Across Domains","abstract":"Identifying analogies across domains without supervision is a key task for artificial intelligence.
