The authors acknowledge this but do not offer ways to tackle the issue\n c) conditioning on the label histogram should make the problem easy: one is giving away the number of nodes and the label identities after all; however even in this setup the approach fails more often than not \n d) the graph matching procedure proposed is a rough patch for a much deeper problem\n- the evaluation should include a measure of the capacity of the architecture to :\n a) reconstruct perfectly the input\n b) denoise perturbations over node labels and additional/missing  edges  ","confidence":"4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"GraphVAE: Towards Generation of Small Graphs Using Variational Autoencoders","abstract":"Deep learning on graphs has become a popular research topic with many applications.
