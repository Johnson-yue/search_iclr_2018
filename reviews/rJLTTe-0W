The authors propose an estimator that is computed by minimizing a deformed Bregman divergence. The authors prove that the proposed estimator is more computationally efficient and more robust than the maximal likelihood estimator (MLE), both in theory and simulation.  \n\n\nMajor Comments:\n\n1. After the definition 1, the likelihood $L(\\theta)$ is defined to be the sum of $\\log \\bar{q}_{\\theta}(x_i).$ Why the gradient of $L(\\theta)$ is a related to $\\tilde{p}$.\n\n2. After the equation (4), when the authors say $f=(U’)^{-1}$ the authors assume that the first order derivative of $U$ should be a strictly increasing function (otherwise the inverse function is not well defined, at least in classic notations). I would like to know whether we only need assume the convexity of $U$. Are there other assumptions?  \n\n3. In Proposition 1, I think the “Fisher consistent” means that (6) holds for any reasonable $U$ and $f$ just as the authors said before Proposition 1. It is better to add this in the statement of Proposition 1 too.  \n\n4. The “Proof 1” is better to be replaced with “Proof of Proposition 1” (same issues for “Proof 2”, “Proof 3”, etc). \n\n5. In the statement of Theorem 1, do the authors have any constraint for $U$?\n\n6. $\\xi_{U,f}$ appears in Theorem 2 without a clear definition. Even if it seems to be defined in (17), it is better to be defined again. \n\n7. Why Theorem 2 indicates that “the estimator (5) is not influenced so much by the outlier”?\n\n8. How to solve (5)? Is it trivial? I expect to see something like “We use … algorithm or toolbox to solve (5)“.   \n\nMinor Comments:\n\n1. In Example 2, I suggest use some more beautiful symbol like $\\top$ to denote the transpose instead of $T$. \n\n2. The length of the equations should not exceed the line-width (e.g., (4) and (7)). \n\n3. In page 5, “We find some examples satisfying 25 in Theorem 2”. The “25” should be “(25)”.","confidence":"5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Bayesian Time Series Forecasting with Change Point and Anomaly Detection","abstract":"Time series forecasting plays a crucial role in marketing, finance and many other quantitative fields.

The comparison is provided only with very simple methods,\n- the proposed model itself looks very similar to what can be found across econometric literature,\n- the datasets, used for comparison, are very scarce. There are datasets for anomaly detection in time-series data, which should be used for extensive comparison, e.g. Numenta Anomaly Detection Benchmark.\n\nTherefore, also the paper is well-written, \n- it lacks novelty,\n- its topic does not perfectly fit topics of interest for ICLR,\nSo, I do not recommend this paper to be published.","confidence":"5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Bayesian Time Series Forecasting with Change Point and Anomaly Detection","abstract":"Time series forecasting plays a crucial role in marketing, finance and many other quantitative fields.

It develops algorithms for inference and forecasting. The performance is evaluated and compared against state-of-the-art methods on three data sets: 1) synthetic data obtained from the generative Bayesian model itself; 2) well-log data; 3) internet traffic data.\n\nOn the methodological side, this appears to be a solid and significant contribution, although I am not sure how well it is aligned with the scope of ICLR. The introduced model is elegant; the algorithms for inference are non-trivial.\n\nFrom a practical perspective, one cannot expect this contribution to be ground-breaking, since there has been more than 40 years of work on time series forecasting, change point and anomaly detection. In some situations the methodology proposed here will work better than previous approaches (particularly in the situation where the data comes from the Bayesian model itself - in that case, there clearly is no better approach), in other cases (which the paper might have put less emphasis on), previous approaches will work better. To position this kind of work, I think it is important the authors discuss the limitations of their approach. Some guidelines on when or when not to use it would be valuable. Clearly, these days one cannot introduce methodology in this area and expect it to outperform existing methods under all circumstances (and hence practitioners to always choose it over any other existing method).\n\nWhat is surprising is that relatively simple approaches like ETS or STL work pretty much equally well (in some cases even better in terms of MSE) than the proposed approach, while more recent approaches - like BSTS - dramatically fail. It would be good if the authors could comment on why this might be the case.\n\nSummary:\n+ Methodology appears to be a significant, solid contribution.\n- Experiments are not conclusive as to when or when not to choose this approach over existing methods\n- writing needs to be improved (large number of grammatical errors and typos, e.g. 'Mehtods')","confidence":"3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Bayesian Time Series Forecasting with Change Point and Anomaly Detection","abstract":"Time series forecasting plays a crucial role in marketing, finance and many other quantitative fields.
