Instead of alternating between clean and examples generated on-the-fly by the fast gradient sign during training, the model training is performed by alternating clean examples and adversarial examples generated from pre-trained models. The motivation behind this change is that one-step method to generate adversarial examples fail at generating good adversarial examples when applied to models trained in the adversarial setting. In contrast, one-step methods applied to models trained only on natural data generate adversarial examples that transfer reasonably well, even on models trained with usual adversarial training. The authors also propose a slight modification to the fast gradient sign method, in which an adversarial example is created using a random perturbation and the current model's gradient, which seems to work better than the fast gradient sign method. Experiments with inception models on ImageNet show increased robustness both against \"black-box\" attacks using held-out models not used in ensemble adversarial training.\n\nOne advantage of the method is that it is extremely simple. It uses pre-trained models that are readily available, and gains robustness against several well-known adversaries widely considered in the state of the art. The experiments are carried out on ImageNet and are seriously conducted.\n\nOn the negative side, there is a significant loss in accuracy, and the models are more vulnerable to white-box attacks than using standard adversarial training. As the authors discuss in the conclusion, this leaves open the question as to whether the models are indeed more robust, or whether it is an artifact of the static black-box attack schemes that are considered in the paper, which measures how much a single model is robust to adversarial examples for other models that were trained independently. For instance, there are no experiments against what is called adaptive black-box adversaries; one could also imagine finding adversarial examples that are trained to fool all models in a predefined collection of models. In the end, while the work presented in the paper found its use in the recent NIPS competition on defending against adversarial examples, it is still unclear whether this kind of defence would make a difference in critical applications.\n\n","confidence":"4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Ensemble Adversarial Training: Attacks and Defenses","abstract":"Adversarial examples are perturbed inputs designed to fool machine learning models.

(These methods may extend to other machine learning models and domains as well, but that's beyond the scope of this paper.) \n\nThe former standard method for generating adversarially images quickly and using them in training was to do a single gradient step to increase the loss of the true label or decrease the loss of an alternate label. This paper shows that such training methods only lead to robustness against these \"weak\" adversarial examples, leaving the adversarially-trained models vulnerable to multi-step white-box attacks and black-box attacks (adversarial examples generated to attack alternate models).\n\nThere are two proposed solutions. The first is to generate additional adversarial examples from other models and use them in training. This seems to yield robustness against black-box attacks from held-out models as well.  Of course, it requires that you have a somewhat diverse group of models to choose from. If that's the case, why not directly build an ensemble of all the models? An ensemble of neural networks can still be represented as a neural network, although a more computationally costly one. Thus, while this heuristic appears to be useful with current models against current attacks, I don't know how well it will hold up in the future.\n\nThe second solution is to add random noise before taking the gradient step.  This yields more effective adversarial examples, both for attacking models and for training, because it relies less on the local gradient. This is another simple idea that appears to be effective. However, I would be interested to see a comparison to a 2-step gradient-based attack.  R+Step-LL can be viewed as a 2-step attack: a random step followed by a gradient step. What if both steps were gradient steps instead? This interpolates between Step-LL and I-Step-LL, with an intermediate computational cost. It would be very interesting to know if R+Step-LL is more or less effective than 2+Step-LL, and how large the difference is.\n\nI like that this paper demonstrates the weakness of previous methods, including extensive experiments and a very nice visualization of the loss landscape in two adversarial dimensions. The proposed heuristics seem effective in practice, but they're somewhat ad hoc and there is no analysis of how these heuristics might or might not be vulnerable to future attacks.","confidence":"4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Ensemble Adversarial Training: Attacks and Defenses","abstract":"Adversarial examples are perturbed inputs designed to fool machine learning models.
