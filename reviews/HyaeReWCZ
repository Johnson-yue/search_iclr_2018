The authors propose three classification models: the first one exploits only image content; the second fuses, in a multi-modal way, content with information about time; the third one exploits also information about the user posting the photo.\nThe approach differs from previous work mainly in the meshing architecture/labelling scheme used to associate photos to geographic locations, and in the use of time and user information. \nQuantitative evaluation on the Im2GPS dataset shows that the approach has an accuracy comparable to the state of the art (while using less training data). Also, the use of time/user info (slightly) helps improve accuracy.\n\nThe paper is clear and easy to read. The authors provide an extensive quantitative evaluation, trying to highlight the impact of different factors (e.g. mesh resolution, features considered etc.) on accuracy and bias.\n\nHowever, the main concerns are:\n- limited technical contribution: multi-modal approaches to image geolocation were already proposed in previous work. While the authors provide some interesting insights, they do not introduce strong novelties.\n- indeed, quantitative results do not seem to bring enough evidence for considering the proposed approach more effective than the state of the art. Also, the impact of the new features considered on the final model accuracy seems quite limited.\nFor these reasons, the paper seems below the acceptance bar for ICLR.\n\nOther notes:\n- In YFCC100M, the \"time\" associated to an image is the time of upload. This might be very different from the time the image was taken. Do the authors think the results might be significantly different if one had access to the actual capture time?\n- The authors could discuss in more detail what the challenges would be for training an end-to-end model exploiting content, time and user-related features.\n- Would it be possible to train the model on more data, so that a fair comparison with the state of the art can be performed?\n- There are quite a few typos (e.g. Caption Fig. 1: \"tahn\", Sec. 3.1.1: Refinment, Figure 3.1.1, Sec. 5: Delunary etc.).","confidence":"4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"MULTI-MODAL GEOLOCATION ESTIMATION USING DEEP NEURAL NETWORKS","abstract":"Estimating the location where an image was taken based solely on the contents of the image is a challenging task, even for humans, as properly labeling an image in such a fashion relies heavily on contextual information, and is not as simple as identifying  a single object in the image.

(2016) to justify publication at ICLR18.)","rating":"3: Clear rejection","review":"The paper deals with global geolocation estimation from a partially sparse set of images. It proposes replacing the usual quad-tree approach with a Delaunay meshing strategy to better cope with low data volumes for geolocation estimation.  The paper is generally well written, experiments are well presented and the application is interesting.\n\nMy main concern is that this is only a slight extension of the PlaNet work of Weyand et al. (2016). As described on P3, section 3.1.1, first two rows, the claimed contribution with respect to PlaNet is \"The classification structure is generated using a Delaunay triangle-based meshing architecture. This differs from the PlaNet approach, which utilizes a quad-tree mesh\". That is, the authors replace the quad-tree component of the PlaNet paper with a Delaunay mesh. Moreover, the authors replace the Inception v3 network architecture of PlaNet with Inception v4 (P4, section 3.1.2) and add time meta data (section 3.2).\n\nIf the authors would want to make their meshing strategy the main point of the paper, I would expect them running additional approaches from literature (and not only PlaNet of Weyand et al., (2016)) with the Delaunay approach. This would more generally prove the concept and show that it generalizes to any kind of approach dealing with global geolocation estimation from partially sparse image sets. And still that would probably not be enough for its own paper at a top conference.  \n\nAlthough all of these slight variations do improve numbers slightly, I view them as merely incremental over (Weyand et al., 2016). This seems a very \"applied\" paper without much if any methodological contribution. There is not enough technical novelty to make this a standalone, mature ICLR 2018 paper.  I therefore recommend rejection of this submission from ICLR18.\n \n","confidence":"4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"MULTI-MODAL GEOLOCATION ESTIMATION USING DEEP NEURAL NETWORKS","abstract":"Estimating the location where an image was taken based solely on the contents of the image is a challenging task, even for humans, as properly labeling an image in such a fashion relies heavily on contextual information, and is not as simple as identifying  a single object in the image.
