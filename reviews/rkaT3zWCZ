This was originally adapted from the SUNCG dataset, enhanced with the addition of a physics model and an API for interacting with the environment.  They then focus on a single high-level instruction following task where an agent is randomly assigned at a location in the house and is asked to navigate to a destination described by a high-level concept (“kitchen”) without colliding with objects.  They propose two models with gated-attention architecture for solving this task, a gated-CNN and a gated-LSTM. Whilst the novelty of the two models is questionable (they are adaptations of existing models to the task),  they are a useful addition to enable a benchmark on the task.  The paper in general is well written, and the environment will be a useful addition to the community.\n\nGeneral Comments\n- In the related work section the first part talks about several existing environments.  Whilst the table is useful, for the “large-scale” and “fast-speed”columns, it would be better if there were some numbers attached - e.g.  are these orders of magnitude differences?  Are these amenable to Bayesian optimisation?\n- I  didn’t  see  any  mention  of  a  pre-specified  validation  set  or  pre-defined cross-validation sets.  This would surely be essential for hyperparameter tuning\n- For the discrete action space state what the 12 actions are.\n- The  reward  function  should  be  described  in  more  detail  (can  be  in  appendix).  How is the shortest distance calculated?  As a general comment it seems that this is a very strong (and unrealistic) reward signal, particularly for generalisation.\n- There are a number of hyperparameters (αDDPG, αA3C,  entropy bonus terms, learning rates etc).  Some discussion of how these were chosen and the sensitivity to these parameters were helpful\n- Figures 3 and 4 are hard to compare, as they are separated by a page, and the y-axes are not shared.\n- The additional 3D scenes datasets mentioned by Ankur Handa should be cited.\n\nTypographical Issues\n- Page 1:  intelligence→intelligent \n- Page  4:  On  average,  there  is→On  average,  there  are;  we  write→we wrote\n- Page 7:  softmax-gumbel trick→softmax-Gumbel trick; gumbel-softmax→Gumbel-softmax\n- References.

They also show how the number of available scenes greatly impacts generalization in navigation based tasks. \n2.\tThe authors provide a thorough analysis on the contribution of different feature types (Mask, Depth, RGB) towards the success rate of the goal task. The improvements and generalization brought by the segmentation and depth masks give interesting insights towards building new navigation paradigms for real-world robotics. \n\nWeaknesses:\n1.\tThe authors claim that the proposed environment allows for multiple applications and interactions, however from the description in section 3, the capacities of the simulator beyond navigation are unclear.\nThe dataset proposed, Home3D, adds a number of functionalities over the SUNCG dataset. The SUNCG dataset provides a large number of 3D scanned houses.  The most important contributions with respect to SUNCG are:\n- An efficient renderer: an important aspect.\n- Introducing physics: this is very interesting, unfortunately the contribution here is very small. Although I am sure the authors are planing to move beyond the current state of their implementation, the only physical constraint currently implemented is an occupancy rule and collision detection. This is not technically challenging. \nTherefore, the added novelty with respect to SUNCG is very limited.\n2.\tThe paper presents the proposed task as navigation from high level task description, but given that the instructions are fixed for a given target, there are only 5 possible instructions which are encoded as one-hot vectors. Given this setting, it is unclear the need for a gated attention mechanism. While this limited setting allows for a clear generalization analysis, it would have been good to study a setting with more complex instructions, allowing to evaluate instructions not seen during training.\n3.\tWhile the authors make a good point showing generalization towards unseen scenes, it would have been good to also show generalization towards real scenarios, demonstrating the realistic nature of House3D and the advantages of using non-RGB features.\n4.\tIt would have been good to report an analysis on the number of steps performed by the agent before reaching its goal on the success cases. It seems to me that the continuous policy would be justified in this setting. \nComments\n-\tIt is unclear to me how the reward shaping addition helps generalize to unseen houses at test time, as suggested by the authors.\n-\tI miss a reference to (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.05143.pdf) beyond the AI-THOR environment, given that they also approach target driven navigation using an actor-critic approach.\n\n\nThe paper proposes a new realistic indoor virtual environment, having a much larger number of scenes than similar environments. From the experiments shown, it seems that the scale increase, together with the availability of features such as Segmentation and Depth improve generalization in navigation tasks, which makes it a promising framework for future work on this direction. However, the task proposed seems too simple considering the power of this environment, and the models used to solve the task don’t seem to bring  relevant novelties from previous approaches.

The paper also extends A3C and DDPG (reinforcement learning methods) by augmenting them with gated attention. These methods are applied for the task of navigation.\n\nPaper Strengths:\n- It is interesting that the paper shows generalization to unseen scenes unlike many other navigation methods.\n- The renderer/simulator for SUNCG is useful.\n\nPaper Weaknesses:\nThe paper has the following issues: (1) It oversells the task/framework. The proposed task/framework is not different from what others have done. (2) There is not much novelty in the paper. The SUNCG dataset already exists. Adding a renderer to that is not a big deal. There is not much novelty in the method either. The paper proposes to use gated attention, which is not novel and it does not help much according to Figures 3b and 4b. (3) Other frameworks have more functionalities than the proposed framework. For example, other frameworks have physics or object interaction while this framework is only useful for navigation. (4) The paper keeps mentioning \"Instructions\". This implies that the method/framework handles natural language, while this is not the case. This is over-selling as well.\n\nQuestions and comments:\n\n- Statements like \"On the contrary, we focus on building a flexible platform that intersects with multiple research directions in an efficient manner allowing users to customize the rules and level of complexity to their needs.\" are just over-selling. This environment is not very different from existing platforms.\n\n- What is referred to as “physics” is basically collision detection. It is again over-selling the environment. Other environments model real physics.\n\n- It is not clear what customizable mean in Table 1. I searched through the paper, but did not find any definition for that. All of the mentioned frameworks are customizable.\n\n- \"we compute the approximate shortest distance from the target room to each location in the house\" --> This assumption is somewhat unrealistic since agents in the real world do not have access to such information.\n\n- Instruction is an overloaded word for \"go to a RoomType\". The paper tries to present the tasks/framework as general tasks/framework while they are not.\n\n- In GATED-LSTM, h_t is a function of I. Why is I concatenated again with h_t?\n\n- Success rate is not enough for evaluation. The number of steps should be reported as well.\n\n- The paper should include citations to SceneNet and SceneNet RGBD.\n\n","confidence":"5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Building Generalizable Agents with a Realistic and Rich 3D Environment","abstract":"Towards bridging the gap between machine and human intelligence, it is of utmost importance to introduce environments that are visually realistic and rich in content.

In this work, we build House3D, a rich, extensible and interactive environment that contains over 45,000 human-designed 3D scenes of houses, ranging from single-room studios to multi-storeyed houses, equipped with a diverse set of fully labeled 3D objects, textures and scene layouts, based on SUNCG dataset. Using a subset of houses in this environment, we study the task of RoomNav in which an agent navigates towards a target specified by a high-level instruction. For this, the agent learns to comprehend the scene it lives in by developing perception, understand the instruction by mapping it to the correct semantics, and navigate to the target by obeying the underlying physical laws. We tackle this problem by training RL agents with gated-attention networks and show that our trained agent succeeds in new unseen environments, showing generalization capability.
