The authors argue for the advantages of a generative VAE approach (but without being convincing).  They do not cite the extensive literature on KB completion.  They present experimental results on their own data set, evaluating only against simpler baselines of their own VAE approach, not the pre-existing KB methods.\n\nThe authors seem unaware of a large literature on \"knowledge base completion.\"  E.g. [Bordes, Weston, Collobert, Bengio, AAAI, 2011],  [Socher et al 2013 NIPS], [Wang, Wang, Guo 2015 IJCAI], [Gardner, Mitchell 2015 EMNLP], [Lin, Liu, Sun, Liu, Zhu AAAI 2015], [Neelakantan, Roth, McCallum 2015], \n\nThe paper claims that operating on pre-structured data only (without using text) is an advantage.  I don't find the argument convincing.  There are many methods that can operate on pre-structured data only, but also have the ability to incorporate text data when available, e.g. \"universal schema\" [Riedel et al, 2014].\n\nThe paper claims that \"discriminative approaches\" need to iterate over all possible entity pairs to make predictions.  In their generative approach they say they find outputs by \"nearest neighbor search.\"  But the same efficient search is possible in many of the classic \"discriminatively-trained\" KB completion models also.\n\nIt is admirable that the authors use an interesting (and to my knowledge novel) data set.  But the method should also be evaluated on multiple now-standard data sets, such as FB15K-237 or NELL-995.  The method is evaluated only against their own VAE-based alternatives.  It should be evaluated against multiple other standard KB completion methods from the literature, such as Jason Weston's Trans-E, Richard Socher's Tensor Neural Nets, and Neelakantan's RNNs.\n","confidence":"5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Generative Discovery of Relational Medical Entity Pairs","abstract":"Online healthcare services can provide the general public with ubiquitous access to medical knowledge and reduce the information access cost for both individuals and societies.

The model is quite simple and intuitive and the authors demonstrate that it can generate meaningful relationships between pairs of entities that were not observed before.  \nWhile the paper is very well-written I have certain concerns regarding the motivation, model, and evaluation methodology followed:\n\n1) A stronger motivation for this model is required. Having a generative model for causal relationships between symptoms and diseases is \"intriguing\" yet I am really struggling with the motivation of getting such a model from word co-occurences in a medical corpus. I can totally buy the use of the proposed model as means to generate additional training data for a discriminative model used for information extraction but the authors need to do a better job at explaining the downstream applications of their model. \n\n2) The word embeddings used seem to be sufficient to capture the \"knowledge\" included in the corpus. An ablation study of the impact of word embeddings on this model is required. \n\n3) The authors do not describe how the data from xywy.com were annotated. Were they annotated by experts in the medical domain or random users?\n\n4) The metric of quality is particularly ad-hoc. Meaningful relationships in a medical domain and evaluation using random amazon mechanical turk workers do not seem to go well together. \n\n5) How does the proposed methods compare against a simple trained extractor? For instance one can automatically extract several linguistic features of the sentences two known related entities appeared with and learn how to extract data. The authors need to compare against such baselines or justify why they cannot be used.\n","confidence":"4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Generative Discovery of Relational Medical Entity Pairs","abstract":"Online healthcare services can provide the general public with ubiquitous access to medical knowledge and reduce the information access cost for both individuals and societies.
