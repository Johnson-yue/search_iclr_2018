The work is fairly novel in its approach, combining a learned reward estimator with a contextual bandit algorithm for exploration/exploitation. The paper was mostly clear in its exposition, however some additional information of the motivation for why the said reduction is better than simpler alternatives would help.  \n\nPros\n1. The results on bandit structured prediction problems are pretty good\n2. The idea of a learnt credit assignment function, and using that to separate credit assignment from the exploration/exploitation tradeoff is good. \n\nCons: \n1. The method seems fairly more complicated than PPO / A2C, yet those methods seem to perform equally well on the RL problems (Figure 2.). It also seems to be designed only for discrete action spaces.\n2. Reslope Boltzmann performs much worse than Reslope Bootstrap, thus having a bag of policies helps. However, in the comparison in Figures 2 and 3, the policy gradient methods dont have the advantage of using a bag of policies. A fairer comparison would be to compare with methods that use ensembles of Q-functions. (like this https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.01502 by Chen et al.). The Q learning methods in general would also have better sample efficiency than the policy gradient methods.\n3. The method claims to learn an internal representation of a denser reward function for the sparse reward problem, however the experimental analysis of this is pretty limited (Section 5.3). It would be useful to do a more thorough investigation of whether it learnt a good credit assignment function in the games. One way to do this would be to check the qualitative aspects of the function in a well understood game, like Blackjack.\n\nSuggestions:\n1. What is the advantage of the method over a simple RL method that predicts a reward at every step (such that the dense rewards add up to match the sparse reward for the episode), and uses this predicted dense reward to perform RL? This, and also a bigger discussion on prior bandit learning methods like LOLS will help under the context for why weâ€™re performing the reduction stated in the paper.  \n\nSignificance: While the method is novel and interesting, the experimental analysis and the explanations in the paper leave it unclear as to whether its significant compared to prior work.","confidence":"4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"RESIDUAL LOSS PREDICTION: REINFORCEMENT LEARNING WITH NO INCREMENTAL FEEDBACK","abstract":"We consider reinforcement learning and bandit structured prediction problems with very sparse loss feedback: only at the end of an episode.

The ideas presented are interesting and the results are potentially interesting as well.   However, I have some reservations, a significant portion of which stem from not understanding aspects of the proposed approach and theoretical results, as outlined below.\n\n\n\nThe algorithm design and theoretical results in the appendix could be made substantially more rigorous. Specifically:\n\n--  basic notations such as regret (in Theorem 1), the total reward (J), Q-value (Q), and value function (V) are not defined.  While these concepts are fairly standard, it would be highly beneficial to define them formally. \n\n-- I'm not convinced that the \"terms in the parentheses\" (Eq. 7) are \"exactly the contextual bandit cost\".  I would like to see a more rigorous derivation of the connection.  For instance, one could imagine that the policy disadvantage should be the difference between the residual costs of the bandit algorithm and the reference policy, rather than just the residual cost of the bandit algorithm. \n\n-- I'm a little unclear in the proof of Theorem 1 where Q(s,pi_n) from Eq 7 fits into Eq 8.\n\n-- The residual cost used for CB.update depends on estimated costs at other time steps h!=h_dev.  Presumably, these estimated costs will change as learning progresses.  How does one reconcile that?  I imagine that it could somehow work out using a bandit algorithm with adversarial guarantees, but I can also imagine it not working out.  I would like to see a rigorous treatment of this issue.\n\n-- It would be nice to see an end-to-end result that instantiates Theorem 1 (and/or Theorem 2) with a contextual bandit algorithm to see a fully instantiated guarantee.  \n\n\n\nWith regards to the algorithm design itself, I have some confusions:\n\n-- How does one create x in practice? I believe this is described in Appendix H, but it's not obvious.  \n\n-- What happens if we don't have a good way to generate x and it must be learned as well?  I'd imagine one would need larger RNNs in that case. \n\n-- If x is actually learned on-the-fly, how does that impact the theoretical results?\n\n-- I find it curious that there's no notion of future reward learning in the learning algorithm.  For instance, in Q learning, one directly models the the long-term (discounted) rewards during learning.  In fact, the theoretical analysis talks about advantage functions as well.  It would be nice to comment on this aspect at an intuitive level.\n\n\n\nWith regards to the experiments:\n\n-- I find it very curious that the results are so negative for using only 1-dev compared to multi-dev (Figure 9 in Appendix).  Given that much of the paper is devoted to 1-dev, it's a bit disappointing that this issue is not analyzed in more detail, and furthermore the results are mostly hidden in the appendix.\n\n-- It's not clear if a reference policy was used in the experiments and what value of beta was used.\n\n-- Can the authors speculate about the difference in performance between the RL and bandit structured prediction settings?  My personal conjecture is that the bandit structured prediction settings are more easily decomposable additively, which leads to a greater advantage of the proposed approach, but I would like to hear the authors' thoughts.\n\n\n\nFinally, the overall presentation of this paper could be substantially improved.  In addition to the above uncertainties, some more points are described below.  I don't view these points as \"deal breakers\" for determining accept/reject.\n\n-- This paper uses too many examples, from part-of-speech tagging to credit assignment in determining paths.  I recommend sticking to one running example, which substantially reduces context switching for the reader.  In every such example, there are extraneous details are not relevant to making the point, and the reader needs to spend considerable effort figuring that out for each example used.  \n\n-- Inconsistent language. For instance, x is sometimes referred to as the \"input example\", \"context\" and \"features\".\n\n-- At the end of page 4, \"Internally, ReslopePolicy takes a standard learning to search step.\"  Two issues: 1) ReslopePolicy is not defined or referred to anywhere else.  2) is the remainder of that paragraph a description of a \"standard learning to search step\"?\n\n-- As mentioned before, Regret is not defined in Theorem 1 & 2.\n\n-- The discussion of the high-level algorithmic concepts is a bit diffuse or lacking.  For instance, one key idea in the algorithmic development is that it's sufficient to make a uniformly random deviation.  Is this idea from the learning to search literature?  If so, it would be nice to highlight this in Section 2.2.\n\n","confidence":"5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"RESIDUAL LOSS PREDICTION: REINFORCEMENT LEARNING WITH NO INCREMENTAL FEEDBACK","abstract":"We consider reinforcement learning and bandit structured prediction problems with very sparse loss feedback: only at the end of an episode.

The method is evaluated on several RL environments against state of the art RL algorithms. It is also evaluated on bandit structured prediction tasks.\nAn interesting synthetic experiment (Figure 4) is also proposed to study the ability of the algorithm to work on both decomposable and non-decomposable structured prediction tasks.\n\n\nQuestion 1: The credit assignment approach you propose seems way more sophisticated than eligibility traces in TD learning. But sometimes old and simple methods are not that bad.
