All of their evaluation is based on the accuracy of defogging. \n\nGranted, being able to infer hidden states is of course an important problem, but the authors appear to mainly have applied existing techniques to a benchmark that has minimal practical significance outside of being able to win StarCraft competitions, meaning that, at least as the paper is currently framed, the critical evaluation metric would be showing that a defogger helps to win games. \n\nTwo ways I could image the contribution being improved are either highlighting and generalizing novel insights gleaned from the process of building the neural network that could help people build \"defoggers\" for other domains (and spelling out more explicitly what domains the authors expect their insights to generalize to), or doubling down on the StarCraft application specifically and showing that the defogger helps to win games.  A minimal version of the second modification would be having a bot that has access to a defogger play against a bot that does not have access to one.\n \nAll that said, as a paper on an application of deep learning, the paper appears to be solid, and if the area chairs are looking for that sort of contribution, then the work seems acceptable.\n\nMinor points:\n- Is there a benefit to having a model that jointly predicts unit presence and count, rather than having two separate models (e.g., one that feeds into the next)?  Could predicting presence or absence separately be a way to encourage sparsity, since absence of a unit is already representable as a count of zero?  The choice to have one model seems especially peculiar given the authors say they couldn't get one set of weights that works for both their classification and regression tasks\n- Notation: I believe the space U is never described in the main text. What components precisely does an element of U have?\n- The authors say they use gameplay from no later than 11 minutes in the game to avoid the difficulties of increasing variance. How long is a typical game?  Is this a substantial fraction of the time of the games studied?  If it is not, then perhaps the defogger would not help so much at winning.\n- The F1 performance increases are somewhat small. The L1 performance gains are bigger, but the authors only compare L1 on true positives. This means they might have very bad error on false positives. (The authors state they are favoring the baseline in this comparison, but it would be nice to have those numbers.)\n- I don't understand when the authors say the deep model has better memory than baselines (which includes a perfect memory baseline)","confidence":"1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Forward Modeling for Partial Observation Strategy Games - A StarCraft Defogger","abstract":"This paper we present a defogger, a model that learns to predict future hidden information from partial observations.

Authors introduce rather heavy notation which is then used in a confusing way. For example, what is the top index in $s_t^{3-p}$ supposed to mean? The notation is not much used after sec. 3.1, for example, figure 1 does not use it. \n* A related issue, is that the definition of metrics is very informal and, again, does not use the already defined notation. Including explicit formulas would be very helpful, because, for example, it looks like when reported in table 1 the metrics are spatially averaged, yet I could not find an explicit notion of that.\n* Authors seem to only consider deterministic defogging models. However, to me it seems that even in 15 game steps the uncertainty over the hidden state is quite high and thus any deterministic model has a very limited potential in prediction it. At least the concept of stochastic predictions should be discussed\n* The rule-based baselines are not described in detail. What does “using game rules to infer the existence of unit types” mean?\n* Another detail which I found missing is whether authors use just a screen, a mini-map or both. In the game of Starcraft, only screen contains information about unit-types, but it’s field of view is limited. Hence, it’s unclear to me whether a model should infer hidden information based on just a single screen + minimap observation (or a history of them) or due to how the dataset is constructed, all units are observed without spatial limitations of the screen. \n","confidence":"4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Forward Modeling for Partial Observation Strategy Games - A StarCraft Defogger","abstract":"This paper we present a defogger, a model that learns to predict future hidden information from partial observations.
