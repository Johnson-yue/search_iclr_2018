They optimize Kuiper-based nonparametric loss and apply the approach on a large social network data-set.  However, the details of the deep learning approach are not well described. Some specific comments are given below.\n\n1.Further details on use of 10-fold cross validation need to be discussed including over-fitting aspect.\n2. Details on deep learning, number of hidden layers, number of hidden units, activation functions, weight adjustment details on each learning methods should be included.\n\n3. Conclusion section is very brief and can be expanded by including a discussion on results comparison and  over fitting aspects in cross validation. Use of Kuiper-based nonparametric loss should also be justified as there are other loss functions can be used under these settings.\n","confidence":"5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"A Deep Learning Approach for Survival Clustering without End-of-life Signals","abstract":"The goal of survival clustering is to map subjects (e.g., users in a social network, patients in a medical study) to $K$ clusters ranging from low-risk to high-risk.

There is no useful statistical setup described (what is random? etc etc), the interplay between censoring and end-of-life is left rather fuzzy, and mentioned clustering approaches are extensively studied in the statistical literature in so-called frailty analysis. The setting is also covered in statistics in the extensive literature on repeated measurements  and even time-series analysis. It's up to the authors discuss similarities and differences of results of the present approach and those areas.\n\nThe numerical result is not assessing the different design decisions of the approach (why use a Kuyper loss?) in this empirical paper.\n\n","confidence":"4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"A Deep Learning Approach for Survival Clustering without End-of-life Signals","abstract":"The goal of survival clustering is to map subjects (e.g., users in a social network, patients in a medical study) to $K$ clusters ranging from low-risk to high-risk.

","rating":"6: Marginally above acceptance threshold","review":"Pros:\nThe paper is a nice read, clearly written, and its originality is well stated by the authors, “addressing the lifetime clustering problem without end-of-life signals for the first time”. I do not feel experienced enough in the field to evaluate the significance of this work.\n\nThe approach proposed in the manuscript is mainly based on a newly-designed nonparametric loss function using the Kuiper statistic and uses a feed-forward neural network to optimize the loss function. This approach does challenge some traditional assumptions, such as the presence of end-of-life signals or the artificial defined timeouts. Instead of giving a clear end-of-life signal, the authors specify a probability of end-of-life that permits us to take into account the associated uncertainty. By analyzing a large-scale social network dataset, it is shown that the proposed method performs better on average than the other two traditional models.\n\nCons:       \nI think that the main drawback of the paper is that the structure of the neural network and the deep learning techniques used for optimizing the loss function are not explained in sufficient detail.
