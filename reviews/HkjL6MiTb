They propose directly optimizing the time-dependent discrimination index using a siamese survival network. Experiments on several real-world dataset reveal modest gains in comparison with the state of the art.\n\n- The authors should clearly highlight what is their main technical contribution. For example, Eqs. 1-6 appear to be background material since the time-dependent discrimination index is taken from the literature, as the authors point out earlier. However, this is unclear from the writing. \n\n- One of the main motivations of the authors is to propose a model that is specially design to avoid the nonidentifiability issue in an scenario with competing risks. It is unclear why the authors solution is able to solve such an issue, specially given the modest reported gains in comparison with several competitive baselines. In other words, the authors oversell their own work, specially in comparison with the state of the art.\n\n- The authors use off-the-shelf siamese networks for their settting and thus it is questionable there is any novelty there. The application/setting may be novel, but not the architecture of choice.\n\n- From Eq. 4 to Eq. 5, the authors argue that the denominator does not depend on the model parameters and can be ignored. However, afterwards the objective does combine time-dependent discrimination indices of several competing risks, with different denominator values. This could be problematic if the risks are unbalanced.\n\n- The competitive gain of the authors method in comparison with other competing methods is minor.\n\n- The authors introduce F(t, D | x) as cumulative incidence function (CDF) at the beginning of section 2, however, afterwards they use R^m(t, x), which they define as risk of the subject experiencing event m before t. Is the latter a proxy for the former?

The authors optimize for the c-index by minimizing a loss function driven by the cumulative risk of competing risk m and correct ordering of comparable pairs. While the idea of optimizing directly for the c-index directly is a good one (with an approximation and with useful complementary loss function terms), the paper leaves something to be desired in quality and clarity.\n\nRelated works:\n- For your consideration: is multi-task survival analysis effectively a competing risks model, except that these models also estimate risk after the first competing event (i.e. in a competing risks model the rates for other events simply go to 0 or near-zero)? Please discuss. Also, if the claim is that there are not deep learning survival analyses, please see, e.g. Jing and Smola.\n- It would be helpful to define t_k explicitly to alleviate determining whether it is the interval time between ordered events or the absolute time since t_0 (it's the latter). Consider calling k a time index instead of t_k a time interval (\"subject x experiences cause m occurs [sic] in a time interval t_k\")\n- Line after eq 8: do you mean accuracy term?\n- I would not call Reg a regularization term since it is not shrinking the coefficients. It is a term to minimize a risk not a parameter.\n- You claim to adjust for event imbalance and time interval imbalance but this is not mathematically shown nor documented in the experiments.\n- The results show only one form of comparison, and the results have confidence intervals that overlap with at least one competing method in all tasks.","confidence":"4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Siamese Survival Analysis","abstract":"Survival Analysis (time-to-event analysis) in the presence of multiple possible adverse events, i.e., competing risks, is a challenging, yet very important problem in medicine, finance, manufacturing etc. Extending classical survival analysis to competing risks is not trivial since only one event (e.g. one cause of death) is observed and hence, the incidence of an event of interest is often obscured by other related competing events.
