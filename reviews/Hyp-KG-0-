It replaces the standard scalogram of SN with a 3D tensor by including wavelet families so that the network can extract more features form data. An empirical risk was introduced and was used to determine the thresholding operator to handle noise in the data. The proposed DCSN and SDCSN significantly outperform the SN, and the proposed thresholding is particularly effective on relatively small data sets. One concern I have is that it is unclear how the proposed method compare with existing deep learning methods. The only comparisons made were with SN. Furthermore, there are some notation in Section 2 of the paper that are not clearly explained, which makes some part of the section hard to understand. Also, the idea of using a family of wavelets seems quite straightforward.","confidence":"4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Sparse Deep Scattering Croisé Network","abstract":"In this work, we propose the Sparse Deep Scattering Croisé Network (SDCSN) a novel architecture based on the Deep Scattering Network (DSN). The DSN is achieved by cascading  wavelet transform convolutions with a complex modulus and a time-invariant operator. We extend this work by first,\ncrossing multiple wavelet family transforms to increase the feature diversity while avoiding any learning. Thus providing a more informative latent representation and benefit from the development of highly specialized wavelet filters over the last decades. Beside, by combining all the different wavelet representations, we reduce the amount of prior information needed regarding the signals at hand.\nSecondly, we develop an optimal thresholding strategy for over-complete filter banks that regularizes the network and controls instabilities such as inherent non-stationary noise in the signal. Our systematic and principled solution sparsifies the latent representation of the network by acting as a local mask distinguishing between activity and noise. Thus, we propose to enhance the DSN by increasing the variance of the scattering coefficients representation as well as improve its robustness with respect to non-stationary noise.\nWe show that our new approach is more robust and outperforms the DSN on a bird detection task.","pdf":"/pdf/71574323fc19eb7fda5722193c5c7e18d2b94fc2.pdf","TL;DR":"We propose to enhance the Deep Scattering Network  in order to improve control and stability of any given machine learning pipeline by proposing a continuous wavelet thresholding scheme","paperhash":"anonymous|sparse_deep_scattering_croisé_network","_bibtex":"@article{\n  anonymous2018sparse,\n  title={Sparse Deep Scattering Croisé Network},\n  author={Anonymous},\n  journal={International Conference on Learning Representations},\n  year={2018},\n  url={https://openreview.net/forum?id=Hyp-KG-0-}\n}","withdrawal":"Confirmed","authors":["Anonymous"],"authorids":["ICLR.cc/2018/Conference/Paper881/Authors"],"keywords":["Deep Scattering Network","Continuous Wavelet Thresholding","Sparse Activations","Time-frequency represenation","Multi-Family","Wavelets","Convolutional Network","Bird Detection"]}}],"limit":2000,"offset":0}
