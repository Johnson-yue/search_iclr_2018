The paper investigates the importance of having the identity skip connections in residual block. The authors hypothesize that changing the identity mapping into a linear function would be beneficial. The main contribution of the paper is the Tandem Block, that is composed of two paths, linear and nonlinear, the outcome of two paths is summed at the end of the block. Similarly, as for residual blocks in ResNets, one can stack together multiple Tandem Blocks. However, this contribution seems to be rather limited. He at. al. (2016) introduces a Tandem Block like structure, very similar to B_(1x1)(2,w), see Fig. 2(e) in He at. al. (2016). Moreover, He et. al (2016) shows in Tab 1 that for a ResNet 101 this tandem like structure performs significantly worse than identity skip connections. This should be properly mentioned, discussed and reflected in the contributions of the paper. \n\nResult section: \nMy main concern is that it seems that the comparison of different Tandem Blocks designs has been performed on test set (e. g. Table 2 displays the highest test accuracies) . Figs 3, 4, 5 and 6 together with Tab. 2 monitors test set. The architectural search together with hyperparameters selection should be performed on validation set. \n\n\nOther issues:\n- Section 1: “… ResNets have overcome the challenging technical obstacles of vanishing/exploding gradients… “. It is clear how ResNet address the issue of vanishing gradients, however, I’m not sure if ResNet can also address the problem of exploding gradients. Can authors provide reference for this statement?\n- Experiments: The authors show that on small size networks Tandem Block outperforms Residual Blocks, since He at. al. (2016) in Tab 1 showed a contrary effect, does it mean that the observations do not scale to higher capacity networks? Could the authors comment on that?

The authors hypothesize that the success of shortcut connections comes from the combination of linear and non-linear features at each layer and propose to substitute the identity shortcuts with a convolutional one (without non-linearity). This alternative is referred to as tandem block. Experiments are performed on a variety of image classification tasks such as CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, SVHN and Fashion MNIST.\n\nThe paper is well structured and easy to follow. The main contribution of the paper is the comparison between identity skip connections and skip connections with one convolutional layer.\n\nMy main concerns are related to the contribution of the paper and experimental pipeline followed to perform the comparison. First, the idea of having convolutional shortcuts was already explored in the ResNet paper (see https://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.05027.pdf). Second, given Figures 3-4-5-6, it would seem that the authors are monitoring the performance on the test set during training. Moreover, results on Table 2 are reported as the ones with “the highest test accuracy achieved with each tandem block”. Could the authors give more details on how the hyperparameters of the architectures/optimization were chosen and provide more information on how the best results were achieved?\n\nIn section 3.5, the authors mention that batchnorm was not useful in their experiments, and was more sensitive to the learning rate value. Do the authors have any explanation/intuition for this behavior?\n\nIn section 4, authors claim that their results are competitive with the best published results for a similar number of parameters. It would be beneficial to add the mentioned best performing models in Table 2 to back this statement. Moreover, it seems that in some cases such as SVHN the differences between all the proposed blocks are too minor to draw any strong conclusions. Could those differences be due to, for example, luck in picking the initialization seed? How many times was each experiment run? If more than once, what was the std?\n\nThe experiments were performed on relatively shallow networks (8 to 26 layers). I wonder how the conclusions drawn scale to much deeper networks (of 100 layers for example) and on larger datasets such as ImageNet.\n\nFigures 3-5 are not referenced nor discussed in the text.\n\nFollowing the design of the tandem blocks proposed in the paper, I wonder why the tandem block B3x3(2,w) was not included.\n\nFinally, it might be interesting to initialize the convolutions in the shortcut connections with the identity, and check what they have leant at the end of the training.\n\nSome typos that the authors might want to fix:\n\n- backpropegation -> backpropagation (Introduction, paragraph 3)\n- dropout is a kind of regularization as well (Introduction, second to last paragraph)\n- nad -> and (Sect 3.1. paragraph 1)\n","confidence":"4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Tandem Blocks in Deep Convolutional Neural Networks","abstract":"Due to the success of residual networks (ResNets) and related architectures, shortcut connections have quickly become standard tools for building convolutional neural networks.

The authors find that in their experiments, performance improves. Therefore, the power of skip connections is due to their linearity rather than due to the fact that they represent the identity.\n\nOverall, the paper has a clear and simple message and is very readable. The paper contains a good amount of experiments, but in my opinion not quite enough to conclude that identity skip connections are inherently worse. The question is then: how non-trivial is it that tandem networks work? For someone who understands and has worked with ResNet and similar architectures, this is not a surprise. Therefore, the paper is somewhat marginal but, I think, still worth accepting.\n\nWhy did you choose a single learning rate for all architectures and datasets instead of choosing the optimal one for each archtitecture and dataset? Was it a question of computational resources? Using custom step sizes would strenghten your experimental results significantly. In the absence of this, I would still ask that you create an appendix where you specify exactly how hyperparameters were chosen.\n\nOther comments:\n\n- \"and that it’s easier for a layer to learn from a starting point of keeping things the same (the identity map) than from the zero map\" I don't understand this comment. Networks without skip connections are not initialized to the zero map but have nonzero, usually Gaussian, weights.\n- in section 2, reason (ii), you seem to imply that it is a good thing if a network behaves as an ensemble of shallower networks. In general, this is a bad thing. Therefore, the fact that ResNet with tandom networks is an ensemble of shallower networks is a reason for why it might perform badly, not well. I would suggest removing reason (ii).\n- in section 3, reason (iii), you state that removing nonlinearities from the skip path can improve performance. However, using tandom blocks instead of identity skip connections does not change the number of nonlinearity layers. Therefore, I do not see how reason (iii) applies to tandem networks.\n- \"The best blocks in each challenge were competitive with the best published results for their numbers of parameters; see Table 2 for the breakdown.\" What are the best published results? I do not see them in table 2.","confidence":"4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Tandem Blocks in Deep Convolutional Neural Networks","abstract":"Due to the success of residual networks (ResNets) and related architectures, shortcut connections have quickly become standard tools for building convolutional neural networks.
