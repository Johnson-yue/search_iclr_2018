","rating":"4: Ok but not good enough - rejection","review":"Summary:\n\nThe paper considers the framework of manifold transport operator learning of Culpepper and Olshausen (2009), and interpret it as obtaining a MAP estimate under a probabilistic generative model. Motivated by this interpretation, the authors propose a new similarity metric between data points, which leads to a new manifold embedding method. This also leads the authors to propose a new transfer learning mechanism that can lead to improvements in classification accuracy.\nSome representative simulation results are included to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed methods.\n\nMain comments:\n\nThis direction is interesting.  But unfortunately the paper is confusingly written and several points are never made clear. The conveyed impression is that the proposed methods are mainly incremental additions to the framework of Culpepper and Olshausen.\n\nIt would be far more helpful if the authors would have clearly described the following in more detail:\n-  The new manifold embedding algorithm in Section 2 --  a proper explanation of the similarity measure, what the role of the MSE is in this algorithm, how to choose the parameters gamma and zeta etc.\n- Why the authors claim that this method is more robust than other classical manifold learning methods. There certainly seems to be some robustness improvement over Isomap -- but this is a somewhat weak strawman since Isomap is notoriously prone to improper neighborhood selection.\n- Why the transport operator viewpoint is an improvement over other out-of-sample approaches in manifold learning.\n- Why the data augmentation using learned transport operators would be more beneficial than augmentation using other mechanisms (manual rotations, other generative models).\n\netc.\n\n\nOther comments/questions:\n\n- Bit confused about the experiment for Figure 1. Why set gamma = 0? Also, you seem to be fixing the number of dictionary elements to two (suggesting an ell-0 constraint), but also impose an ell-1 constraint. Why both?\n- From what distribution are the random coefficients governing the transport operators drawn (uniform? gaussian?) how to choose the anchor points?\n- The experiment in USPS digits is somewhat confusing. Rotations are easy to generate, so the \"true rotation\" curve is probably the easiest to implement and also the best performing -- so why go through the transport operator training process at all?  In any case, I would be careful to not draw too many conclusions from a single experiment on MNIST.","confidence":"4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Transfer Learning on Manifolds via Learned Transport Operators","abstract":"Within-class variation in a high-dimensional dataset can be modeled as being on a low-dimensional manifold due to the constraints of the physical processes producing that variation (e.g., translation, illumination, etc.).

Experiments on the swiss roll and synthetic rotated images on USPS digits show that the proposed method could learn useful transformations on the data manifold.\n\nHowever, the experiments in the paper is weak. As the paper mentioned, manifold learning algorithms tend to be quite sensitive to the quality of data, usually requiring dense data at each local neighborhood to successfully learn the manifold well. However, this paper, claiming to be learn more rubust representations, lacks solid supporting experiments. The swiss roll is a very simple synthetic dataset. The USPS is also simple, and the manifold learning is performed on synthetic (rotated) USPS digits with only 1 manifold dimension. I would recommend testing the proposed algorithm on more complicated datasets (e.g. Imagenet or even CIFAR images) to see how well it performs in practice, in order to provide stronger empirical supports for the proposed method. At the current state, I don't think it is good for publishing at ICLR.","confidence":"4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Transfer Learning on Manifolds via Learned Transport Operators","abstract":"Within-class variation in a high-dimensional dataset can be modeled as being on a low-dimensional manifold due to the constraints of the physical processes producing that variation (e.g., translation, illumination, etc.).

This is an old idea, and the stated contribution of the paper is:\n\"The main contribution of this paper is to show that the manifold representation learned in the transport operators is valuable both as a probabilistic model to improve general machine learning tasks as well as for performing transfer learning in classification tasks.\" \nThe paper provide nice illustrative experiments arguing why transport operators may be a useful modeling tool, but does not go beyond illustrative experiments.\nWhile I follow the intuitions behind transport operators I am doubtful if they will generalize beyond very simple manifold structures (see detailed comments below).\n\nQuality:\nThe paper is well-written and fairly easy to follow. In particular, I appreciate that the authors make no attempt to overclaim contributions. From a methodology point-of-view, the paper has limited novelty (transport operators, and learning thereof has been studied elsewhere), but there are some technical insights (likelihood model, use in data augmentation). Since the provided experiments are mostly illustrations, I would argue that the significance of the paper is limited. I'd say that to really convince a broader audience that this old idea is worth revisiting, the work must go beyond illustrations and apply to a real data problem.\n\nDetailed Comments and Questions:\n*) Equation 1 of the paper describe the key dynamics of the applied transport operators. Basically, the paper assume that the underlying data manifold is locally governed by a linear differential equation. This is a very suitable assumption, e.g., for the swiss roll data set, but it is unclear to this reader why it is a suitable assumption beyond such toy data. I would very much appreciate a detailed discussion of when this is a suitable modeling choice, and when it is not. My intuition is that this is mostly a suitable model when the data manifold appears due to simple transformations (e.g. rotations) of data. This is also exactly the type of data considered in the paper.\n*) In Eq. 3, should it be \"expm\" instead of \"exp\" ?\n*) The first two paragraphs of Sec. 2 are background material, whereas paragraph 3 and beyond describe material that is key to the paper. I would recommend introducing a \\subsection (or something like it) to make this more clear.\n*) The idea of working with transformations of data rather than the actual data is the corner-stone of Ulf Grenander's renowned \"Pattern Theory\". A citation to this seminal work would be appropriate.\n*) In the first paragraph of the introduction links are drawn to the neuroscience literature; it would be appropriate to cite a suitable publication.\n\nPros(+) & Cons(-):\n+ Well-written.\n+ Good illustrative experiments.\n- Real-life experiments are lacking.\n- Limited methodology contribution.\n- The assumed dynamics might be too simplistic (at least a discussing of this is missing).\n\nFor the AC:\nThe submitted paper acknowledges several grants (including grant numbers), which can directly be tied to the authors identity. This may be a violation of the double blind review policy. I did not use this information to determine the authors identity, though, so this review is still double blind.","confidence":"4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Transfer Learning on Manifolds via Learned Transport Operators","abstract":"Within-class variation in a high-dimensional dataset can be modeled as being on a low-dimensional manifold due to the constraints of the physical processes producing that variation (e.g., translation, illumination, etc.).
