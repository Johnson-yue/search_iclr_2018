Much of the paper remains unchanged from the time of my previous review. I have revised my review according to the updates in the paper:\n\nSummary of the paper:\nThis work proposes a neural network based alternative to standard CRF post-processing techniques that are generally used on top semantic segmentation CNNs. As an alternative to CRF, this work proposes to iteratively refine the predicted segmentation with a denoising auto encoder (DAE). Results on CamVid semantic segmentation dataset showed better improvements over base CNN predictions in comparison to popular DenseCRF technique.\n\n\nPaper Strengths:\n- A neat technique for incorporating CRF-like pixel label relations into semantic segmentation via neural networks (auto encoders).\n- Promising results on CamVid segmentation dataset with reliable improvements over baseline techniques and minor improvements when used in conjunction with recent models.\n\n\nMajor Weaknesses:\nI have two main concerns for this work:\n- One is related to the novelty as the existing work of Xie et al. ECCV'16 also proposed similar technique with very similar aim.  I think, conceptual or empirical comparisons are required to assess the importance of the proposed approach with respect to existing ones. Mere citation and short discussion is not enough. Moreover, Xie et al. seem to have demonstrated their technique on two different tasks and on three different datasets.\n- Another concern is related to experiments. Authors experimented with only one dataset and with one problem. But, I would either expect some demonstration of generality (more datasets or tasks) or strong empirical performance (state-of-the-art on CamVid) to assess the empirical usefulness with respect to existing techniques. Both of these aspects are missing in experiments. \n\n\nMinor Weaknesses:\n- Negligible improvements with respect to CRF techniques on modern deep architectures.\n- Runtime comparison is missing with respect to baseline techniques. Applying the proposed DAE 40-50 times seems very time consuming for each image.\n- By back-propagating through CRF-like techniques [Zheng et al. ICCV'15, Gadde et al. ECCV'16, Chandra et al. ECCV'16 etc.], one could refine the base segmentation CNN as well. It seems this is also possible with the proposed architecture. Is that correct? Or, are there any problems with the end-to-end fine-tuning as the input distribution to DAE constantly changes? Did authors try this?\n\n\nSuggestions:\n- Only Gaussian noise corruption is used for training DAE. Did authors experiment with any other noise types? Probably, more structured noise would help in learning better contextual relations across pixel labels?\n\nClarifications:\nWhat is the motivation to add Euclidean loss to the standard cross-entropy loss for segmentation in Eq-3?\n\nReview summary:\nThe use of denoising auto encoders (DAEs) for capturing pixel label relations and then using them to iteratively refine the segmentation predictions is interesting. But, incomplete comparisons with similar existing work and limited experiments makes this a weak paper.","confidence":"4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Image Segmentation by Iterative Inference from Conditional Score Estimation","abstract":"Inspired by the combination of feedforward and iterative computations in the visual cortex, and taking advantage of the ability of denoising autoencoders to estimate the score of a joint distribution, we propose a novel approach to iterative inference for capturing and exploiting the complex joint distribution of output variables conditioned on some input variables.

To this end the authors investigate a denoising auto-encoder (DAE). Its purpose is to provide a semantic segmentation which improves upon its input in terms of the log-likelihood.\n\nMore specifically, the authors `propose to condition the autoencoder with an additional input’ (page 1). To this end they use features obtained from the deep net. Instead of training the DAE with ground truth y, the authors found usage of the deep net prediction to yield better results.\n\nThe proposed approach is evaluated on the CamVid dataset.\n\nSummary:\n——\nI think the paper discusses a very interesting topic and presents an elegant approach. A few points are missing which would provide significantly more value to a reader. Specifically, an evaluation on the classical Pascal VOC dataset, details regarding the training protocol of the baseline (which are omitted right now), an assessment regarding stability of the proposed approach (not discussed right now), and a clear focus of the paper on segmentation or conditioning. See comments below for details and other points.\n\nComments:\n——\n1. When training the DAE, a combination of squared loss and categorical cross-entropy loss is used. What’s the effect of the squared error loss and would the categorical cross-entropy on its own be sufficient? This question remains open when reading the submission.\n\n2. The proposed approach is evaluated on the CamVid dataset which is used less compared to the standard and larger Pascal VOC dataset. I conjecture that the proposed approach wouldn’t work too well on Pascal VOC. On Pascal VOC, images are distinctly different from each other whereas subsequent frames are similar in CamVid, i.e., the road is always located at the bottom center of the image. The proposed architecture is able to take advantage of this dataset bias, but would fail to do so on Pascal VOC, which has a much more intricate bias. It would be great if the authors could check this hypothesis and report quantitative results similar to Tab. 1 and Fig. 4 for Pascal VOC.\n\n3. The authors mention a grid-search for the stepsize and the number of iterations. What values were selected in the end on the CamVid and hopefully the Pascal VOC dataset?\n\n4. Was the dense CRF applied out of the box, or were its parameters adjusted for good performance on the CamVid validation dataset? While parameters such as the number of iterations and epsilon are tuned for the proposed approach on the CamVid validation set, the submission doesn’t specify whether a similar procedure was performed for the CRF baseline.\n\n5. Fig. 4 seems to indicate that the proposed approach doesn’t converge. Hence an appropriate stepsize and a reasonable number of iterations need to be chosen on a validation set. Choosing those parameters guarantees that the method performs well on average, but individual results could potentially be entirely wrong, particularly if large step sizes are chosen. I suspect this effect to be more pronounced on the Pascal VOC dataset (hence my conjecture in point 2). To further investigate this property, as a reader, I’d be curious to get to know the standard deviation/variance of the accuracy in addition to the mean IoU. Again, it would be great if the authors could check this hypothesis and report those results.\n\n6. I find the experimental section to be slightly disconnected from the initial description. Specifically, the paper `proposes to condition the autoencoder with an additional input’ (page 1). No experiments are conducted to validate this proposal. Hence the main focus of the paper (image segmentation or DAE conditioning) remains vague. If the authors choose to focus on image segmentation, a comparison to state-of-the-art should be provided on classical datasets such as Pascal VOC, if DAE conditioning is the focus, some experiments in this direction should be included in addition to the Pascal VOC results.\n\nMinor comment:\n——\n- I find it surprising that the authors choose not to cite some related work on combining deep nets with structured prediction.","confidence":"5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Image Segmentation by Iterative Inference from Conditional Score Estimation","abstract":"Inspired by the combination of feedforward and iterative computations in the visual cortex, and taking advantage of the ability of denoising autoencoders to estimate the score of a joint distribution, we propose a novel approach to iterative inference for capturing and exploiting the complex joint distribution of output variables conditioned on some input variables.
