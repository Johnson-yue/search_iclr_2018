The authors then provide several evaluations of complex-valued networks on some standard ML benchmark tasks. They find that the complex-valued networks do not in general perform better than real-valued networks. \n\n====================\nClarity:  I found the paper clear and easy to understand.  In a number of places there are clear signs of sloppiness (e.g. undefined citations).   I found the undefined citations in the middle of page 2 frustrating, since I'd have liked to follow up on those citations as comparison points for this work. \n\nQuality: The mathematical formulas describing basic complex analysis ideas (e.g.  derivatives of complex functions, definitions of complex versions of standard activation functions) seem reasonable to me.   The general approach of assigning a parameter budget to ensure fairness in comparison between complex and real-valued networks seems reasonable --- although of course, since all results should be reported on cross-validated testing subsets anyhow,  parameter equalization is not the only approach to fair evaluation.   \n\nOriginality:  It seems very unclear to me what is added in this paper in comparison to works like (e.g.) Trabelsi (2017).  That and other recent work have provided some systematic evaluations of complex-valued networks, and shown their utility in a number of cases.   The current paper's authors talk about previous work not being well-controlled for number of parameters.   However, at least in some key cases in the recent literature, parameter numbers *were* controlled (see e.g. Table 4 of Trabelsi (2017)).  So I'm not really sure what is being added here. \n\nSignificance:   The paper does not make a great case for caring about complex-valued networks.  Of course, negative results are of value, but it doesn't seem like much is at stake in this work to begin with.   It's not like people expected complex-valued networks to somehow be extremely effective for the tasks discussed here -- so the failure to be better than the real-valued alternatives seems unremarkable.   The paper also doesn't illustrate any novel results on tasks for which it would be reasonable to assume that complex-valued inputs would be particularly important.  (The authors reference some signal processing tasks in the introduction, but don't actually show any results on such tasks.)    \n\n","confidence":"4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Complex- and Real-Valued Neural Network Architectures","abstract":"Complex-value neural networks are not a new concept, however, the use of real-values has often been favoured over complex-values due to difficulties in training and accuracy of results.
