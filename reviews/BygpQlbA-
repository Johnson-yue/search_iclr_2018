Typically this problem is split into a (non-convex) system ID step followed by a derivation of an optimal controller, but there are few guarantees about this combined process.  This manuscript formulates a convex program of optimal control without the separate system ID step, resulting in provably optimality guarantees and efficient algorithms (in terms of the sample complexity).  The paper is generally pretty well written.\n\nThis paper leans heavily on Hazan 2017 paper (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.00946.pdf). Where the Hazan paper concerns itself with the system id portion of the control problem, this paper seems to be the controls extension of that same approach.   From what I can tell, Hazan's paper introduces the idea of wave filtering (convolution of the input with eigenvectors of the Hankel matrix); the filtered output is then passed through another matrix that is being learned online (M). That matrix is then mapped back to system id (A,B,C,D).  The most novel contribution of this ICLR paper seems to be equation (4), where the authors set up an optimization problem to solve for optimal inputs; much of that optimization set-up relies on Hazan's work, though. However, the authors do prove their work, which increases the novelty. The novelty would be improved with clearer differentiation from the Hazan 2017 paper.\n\nMy biggest concerns that dampen my enthusiasm are some assumptions that may not be realistic in most controls settings:\n\n- First, the most concerning assumption is that of a symmetric LDS matrix A (and Lyapunov stability).  As far as I know, symmetric LDS models are not common in the controls community.  From a couple of quick searches it seems like there are a few physics / chemistry applications where a symmetric A makes sense, but the authors don't do a good enough job setting up the context here to make the results compelling. Without that context it's hard to tell how broadly useful these results are.  In Hazan's paper they mention that the system id portion, at least, seems to work with non-symmetric, and even non-linear dynamical systems (bottom of page 3, Hazan 2017). Is there any way to extend the current results to non-symmetric systems?\n\n- Second, it appears that the proposed methods may rely on running the dynamical system several times before attempting to control it.  Am I misunderstanding something?  If so this seems like it may be a significant constraint that would shrink the application space and impact even further.\n","confidence":"3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Towards Provable Control for Unknown Linear Dynamical Systems","abstract":"We study the control of symmetric linear dynamical systems with unknown dynamics and a hidden state.

After obtaining this operator, this paper substitutes this operator to the optimal control problem and solve the optimal control problem to estimate the optimal control input, and show that the gap between the true optimal cost and the cost from applying estimated optimal control input is small with high probability.\nI think estimating the operator from the input to the output is interesting, instead of constructing (A, B, C, D) matrices, but this idea and all the techniques are from Hazan et. el., 2017. After estimating this operator, it is straightforward to use this to generate the estimated optimal control input. So I think the idea is OK, but not a breakthrough.\n\nAlso I found the symmetric matrix assumption on A is quite limited. This limitation is from Hazan et. el., 2017, where the authors wants to predict the output. For prediction purposes, this restriction might be OK, but for control purposes, many interesting plants does not satisfy this assumption, even simple RL circuit. I agree with authors that this is an attempt to combine system identification with generating control inputs together, but I am not sure how to remove the restriction on A.\nDean et. el., 2017 also pursued this direction by combining system identification with robust controller synthesis to handle estimation errors in the system matrices (A, B) in the state-feedback case (LQR), and I can see that Dean et. el. could be extended to handle observer-feedback case (LQG) without any restriction.\n\nDespite of this limitation I think the paper's idea is OK and the result is worth to be published but not in the current form. The paper is not clearly written and there are several areas need to be improved.\n\n1. System identification.\nSubspace identification (N4SID) won't take exponential time. I recommend the authors to perform either proper literature review or cite one or two papers on the time complexity and their weakness. Also note that subspace identification can estimate (A, B, C, D) matrices which is great for control purposes especially for the infinite horizon LQR.\n\n2. Clarification on the unit ball constraints.\nOptimal control inputs are restricted to be inside the unit ball and overall norm is bounded by L. Where is this restriction coming from? The standard LQG setup does not have this restriction.\n\n3. Clarification on the assumption (3).\nWhere is this assumption coming from? I can see that this makes the analysis go through but is this a reasonable assumption?  Does most of system satisfy this constraint? Is there any? It's ok not to provide the answer if it's hard to analyze, but if that's the case the paper should provide some numerical case studies to show this bound either holds or the gap is negligible in the toy example.\n\n4. Proof of theorem 3.3.\nTheorem 3.3 is one of the key results in this paper, yet its proof is just \"noted\". The setup is slightly different from the original theorem in Hazan et. el., 2017 including the noise model, so I strongly recommend to include the original theorem in the appendix, and include the full proof in the appendix.\n\n5. Proof of lemma 3.1.\nI found it's hard to keep track of which one is inside the expectation. I recommend to follow the notation E[variable] the authors been using throughout the paper in the proof instead of dropping these brackets.\n \n6. Minor typos\nIn theorem 2.4, ||Q||_op is used for defining rho, but in the text ||Q||_F is used. I think ||Q||_op is right.","confidence":"3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Towards Provable Control for Unknown Linear Dynamical Systems","abstract":"We study the control of symmetric linear dynamical systems with unknown dynamics and a hidden state.
