A much better title, in retrospect, to reflect the work would be \"Quantum Kernels\", since this is really what we proposed. We just thought that if we are proposing \"Quantum Kernels\"  it is natural to think that it may lead to Quantum CNN, so we use the word \"towards\" in this sense. But again, Quantum Kernels would be the final title if accepted (and if not, we will submit elsewhere with the new title). \nthanks\n\nBut why reject a new idea that is clearly of interest by this community ? we thought we demonstrated well, in theory and the experiments demonstrate it can be applied.

We appreciated your candid remarks and gives us a clear  understanding of the limitations.  We will try to answer some of the points you made and try to plant a seed on your mind to reconsider your \"scores\". \nYes, there are clear references to physics literature and not everyone is familiar. But note that the paper is self contained technically, i.e., all derivations are justified in the paper. The only assumption from physics was the use of a particular Kernel (complex valued one with the optimization criteria in the exponent) and to use it by summing over all paths (we approximated by an empirical sum over the data). So other than that, there is no use of quantum physics.  If you understood the steps, you understood everything (other than the assumption). \nOn the issue of validating our work with simple experiments  we think  this  is a new idea with a new  theoretical basis that could perhaps make an impact in the future (the title may not be appropriate, as we meant \"towards\" to mean, hopefully the direction will get there but most likely we would have to change to \"quantum kernels\").  Also the experiments were meant to be illustration of the theory. So we see the experiments as a demonstration of the theory on a simple shape, but we demonstrated since we compared to the \"classical \" techniques and the theory explained it.  It is novel!! This is what some \"research cultures\" value, new ideas and demonstration of the idea and consider enough to open a field.  We would have thought that if you  appreciate the novelty (and not be distracted by the use of the word quantum) that would put the score up.   But in any case, thank you for your candid review.
