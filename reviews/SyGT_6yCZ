The paper seems to be very thin technically, unless I missed some important details. Two proposals in the paper are:\n\n(1) Using a learning rate decay scheme that is fixed relative to the number of epochs used in training, and \n(2) Extract the penultimate layer output as features to train a conventional classifier such as SVM.\n\nI don't understand why (1) differs from other approaches, in the sense that one cannot simply reduce the number of epochs without hurting performance. And for (2), it is a relatively standard approach in utilizing CNN features. Essentially, if I understand correctly, this paper is proposing to prematurely stop training an use the intermediate feature to train a conventional classifier (which is not that away from the softmax classifier that CNNs usually use). I fail to see how this would lead to superior performance compared to conventional CNNs.","confidence":"4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Simple Fast Convolutional Feature Learning","abstract":"The quality of the features used in visual recognition is of fundamental importance for the overall system.

The acceleration of the training comes from a reduced number of training epocs and a specific schedule decay of the learning rate. \nIn the evaluation the features are used with support vector machines (SVN) and extreme learning machines on MNIST and CIFAR10/100 datasets.\n\nPros:\nThe paper compares different classifiers on three datasets.\n\nCons:\n- Considering an adaptive schedule of the learning decay is common practice in modern machine learning. Showing that by varying the learning rate the authors can reduce the number of training epocs and still obtain good performance is not a contribution and it is actually implemented in most of the recent deep learning libraries, like Keras or Pytorch.\n- It is not clear why, once a CNN has been trained, one should want to change the last layer and use a SVN or other classifiers.\n- There are many spelling errors\n- Comparing CNN based methods with hand-crafted features as in Fig. 1 and Tab.3 is not interesting anymore. It is well known that CNN features are much better if enough data is available.\n","confidence":"4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Simple Fast Convolutional Feature Learning","abstract":"The quality of the features used in visual recognition is of fundamental importance for the overall system.

This work would fit better a workshop as a preliminary result, furthermore it is too short. Following a short review section per section.\n\nIntro: The name SFC is misleading as the method consists in stopping early the training with an optimized learning schedule scheme. Furthermore, the work is not compared to the appropriate baselines.\n\nProposal: The first motivation is not clear. The training time of the feature extractor has never been a problem for transfer learning tasks for example: once it is trained, you can reuse the architecture in a wide range of tasks. Besides, the training time of a CNN on CIFAR10 or even ImageNet is now quite small(for reasonable architectures), which allows fast benchmarking.\nThe second motivation, w.r.t. IB seems interesting but this should be empirically motivated(e.g. figures) in the subsection 2.1, and this is not done.\n\nThe section 3 is quite long and could be compressed to improve the relevance of this experimental section. All the accuracies(unsup dict, unsup, etc) on CIFAR10/CIFAR100 are reported from the paper (Oyallon & Mallat, 2015), ignoring 2-3 years of research that leads to new numerical results. Furthermore, this supervised technique is only compared to unsupervised or predefined methods, which is is not fair and the training time of the Scattering Transform is not reported, for example. \n\nFinally, extracting features is mainly useful on ImageNet (for realistic images) and this is not reported here.\n\nI believe re-thinking new learning rate schedules is interesting, however I recommend the rejection of this paper.","confidence":"4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Simple Fast Convolutional Feature Learning","abstract":"The quality of the features used in visual recognition is of fundamental importance for the overall system.
