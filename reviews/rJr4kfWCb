The comparison is trivial and does not go in depth to explain why one architecture works better than the other. Also, no effort is made to explain the data beyond some superficial description. No example of input data is given (what does an actual input look like). The authors mention \"the RCNN object detector\" in step 18, that presumably does post-processing after the CNN. But there is no explanation of that module anywhere. Instead the authors spend most of the paper listing in wordy details the architecture of their VGG variant. Also, a full page is devoted to detailed explanation of what precision-recall and Matthews Correlation Coefficient is! Overall, the paper does not provide any insight beyond: i tried this, i tried that and this works better than that; a strong reject.","confidence":"5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Lung Tumor Location and Identification with AlexNet and a Custom CNN","abstract":"Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths in the world and early detection is a crucial part of increasing patient survival.
