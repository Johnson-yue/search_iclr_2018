Specifically, the authors proposed a novel architecture to decompose the identity latent code and non-identity latent code. In this new architecture, the generator is unchanged while the discriminator takes pair data as the input, and output the decision of whether two images are from the same identity or not. By training the whole model with a conventional GAN-training regime, SD-GAN learns to take a part of the input Z as the identity information, and the other part of input Z as the non-identity (or attribute) information. In the experiments, the authors demonstrate that the proposed SD-GAN could generate images preserving the same identity with diverse attributes, such as pose, age, expression, etc. Compared with AC-GAN, the proposed SD-GAN achieved better performance in both automatically evaluation metric (FaceNet) and Human Study. In the appendix, the authors further presented ablated qualitative results in various settings.\n\n[Strengths]\n\n1. This paper proposed a simple but effective generative adversarial network, called SD-GAN, to decompose the input latent code of GAN into separate semantical parts. Specifically, it is mainly instantiated on face images, to decompose the identity part and non-identity part in the latent code. Unlike the previous works such as AC-GAN, SD-GAN exploited a Siamese network to replace the conventional discriminator used in GAN. By this way, SD-GAN could generate images of novel identities, rather than being constrained to those identities used during training. I think this is a very good property. Due to this, SD-GAN consumes much less memory than AC-GAN, when training on a large number of identities.\n\n2. In the experiment section, the authors quantitatively evaluate the generated images based on two methods, one is using a pre-trained FaceNet model to measure the verification accuracy and one is human study. When evaluated based on FaceNet, the proposed SD-GAN achieved higher accuracy and obtained more diverse face images, compared with AC-GAN. In human study, SD-GAN achieved comparable verification accuracy, while higher diversity than AC-GAN. The authors further presented ablated experiments in the Appendix.\n\n[Comments]\n\nThis paper presents a novel model to decompose the latent code in a semantic manner. However, I have several questions about the model:\n\n1. Why would SD-GAN not generate images merely have a smaller number of identities or just a few identities? In Algorithm 1, the authors trained the model by sampling one identity vector, which is then concatenated to two observation vectors. In this case, the generator always takes the same identity vectors, and the discriminator is used to distinguish these fake same-identity pair and the real same-identity pair from training data. As such, even if the generator generates the same identity, say mean identity, given different identity vectors, the generated images can still obtain a lower discrimination loss. Without any explicite constraint to enforce the generator to generate different identity with different identity vectors, I am wondering what makes SD-GAN be able to generate diverse identities? \n\n2. Still about the identity diversity. Though the authors showed the identity-matched diversity in the experiments, the diversity across identity on the generated images is not evaluated. The authors should also evaluate this kind of identity. Generally, AC-GAN could generate as many identities as the number of identities in training data. I am curious about whether SD-GAN could generate comparable diverse identity to AC-GAN. One simple way is to evaluate the whole generated image set using Inception Score based on a Pre-trained face identification network; Another way is to directly use the generated images to train a verification model or identification model and evaluate it on real images. Though compared with AC-GAN, SD-GAN achieved better identity verification performance and sample diversity, I suspect the identity diversity is discounted, though SD-GAN has the property of generating novel identities. Furthermore,  the authors should also compare the general quality of generated samples with DC-GAN and BEGAN as well (at least qualitatively), apart from the comparison to AC-GAN on the identity-matched generation.\n\n3. When making the comparison with related work, the authors mentioned that Info-GAN was not able to determine which factors are assigned to each dimension. I think this is not precise. The lack of this property is because there are no data annotations. Given the data annotations, Info-GAN can be easily augmented with such property by sending the real images into the discriminator for classification. Also, there is a typo in the caption of Fig. 10. It looks like each column shares the same identity vector instead of each row.\n\n[Summary]\n\nThis paper proposed a new model called SD-GAN to decompose the input latent code of GAN into two separete semantical parts, one for identity and one for observations. Unlike AC-GAN, SD-GAN exploited a Siamese architecture in discriminator. By this way, SD-GAN could not only generate more identity-matched face image pairs but also more diverse samples with the same identity,  compared with AC-GAN. I think this is a good idea for decomposing the semantical parts in the latent code, in the sense that it can imagine new face identities and consumes less memory during training. Overall, I think this is a good paper. However, as I mentioned above, I am still not clear why SD-GAN could generate diverse identities without any constraints to make the model do that. Also, the authors should further evaluate the diversity of identity and compare it with AC-GAN.","confidence":"4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Semantically Decomposing the Latent Spaces of Generative Adversarial Networks","abstract":"We propose a new algorithm for training generative adversarial networks to jointly learn latent codes for both identities (e.g. individual humans) and observations (e.g. specific photographs).

Assuming images can be disentangled by identity-related factors and style factors, this paper proposed an algorithm that produces a pair of images with the same identity. Compared to standard GAN framework, this algorithm first generated two latent variables for the pair images. The two latent variables are partially shared reflecting the shared identity information. The generator then transformed the latent variables into high-resolution images with a deconvolution decoder networks. The discriminator was used to distinguish paired images from database or paired images sampled by the algorithm. Experiments were conducted using DCGAN and BEGAN on portrait images and shoe product images. Qualitative results demonstrated that the learned style representations capture viewpoint, illumination and background color while the identity was well preserved by the identity-related representations.\n\n\n== Novelty & Significance ==\nPaired image generation is an interesting topic but this has been explored to some extent. Compared to existing coupled generation pipeline such as CoGAN, I can see the proposed formulation is more application-driven.\n\n== Technical Quality ==\nIn Figure 3, the portrait images in the second row and fourth row look quite similar. I wonder if the trained model worked with only limited variability (in terms identity).\nIn Figure 4, the viewpoint is quite limited (only 4 viewpoints are provided).\n\nI am not very convinced whether SD-GAN is a generic algorithm for controlled image generation. Based on the current results, I suspect if it only works in fairly constrained setting. \nIt would be good to know if it actually works in more challenging datasets such as SUN bedroom, CUB and Oxford Flowers. \n\n“the AC-DCGAN model cannot imagine new identities”\nI feel the author of this paper made an unfair argument when comparing AC-DCGAN with the proposed method. First, during training, the proposed SD-GAN needs to access the identity information and there is only limited identity in the dataset. Based on the presentation, it is not very clear how does the model generate novel identities (in contrast to simply interpolating existing identities). For example, is it possible to generate novel viewpoints in Figure 4?\n\nMissing references on conditional image generation and coupled image generation:\n-- Generative Adversarial Text-to-Image Synthesis. Reed et al., In ICML 2016.\n-- Attribute2Image: Conditional Image Generation from Visual Attributes. Yan et al., In ECCV 2016.\n-- Domain Separation Networks. Bousmalis et al., In NIPS 2016.\n-- Unsupervised Image-to-Image Translation Networks. Liu et al., In NIPS 2017.\n\nOverall, I rate this paper slightly above borderline. It showed some good visualization results on controlled image generation. But the comparison to AC-GAN is not very fair, since the identity pairs are fully supervised for the proposed method. As far as I can see, there are no clear-cut improvements quantitatively. Also, there is no comparison with CoGAN, which I believe is the most relevant work for coupled image generation. \n","confidence":"4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Semantically Decomposing the Latent Spaces of Generative Adversarial Networks","abstract":"We propose a new algorithm for training generative adversarial networks to jointly learn latent codes for both identities (e.g. individual humans) and observations (e.g. specific photographs).

The idea for disentangling identity from other factors of variation using identity-matched image pairs is quite simple, but the experimental results on faces and shoes are impressive.\n\nClarity\nThe model and its training objective are simple and clearly explained.\n\nOriginality\nThere are now many, many papers on generative models with disentangled feature representations, including with GANs. However, to my knowledge this is the first paper showing very compelling results using this particular setup of identity-aligned images.\n\nSignificance\nDisentangled generative models are an important line of work in my opinion. This paper presents a very simple but apparently effective way of disentangling identity from other factors, and implements in two of the more recent GAN architectures.\n\nSuggestion for an experiment - can you do few shot image generation? A simple way to do it would be to train an encoder from image → identity encoding. Then, given one or a few images of a new person’s face or a new shoe, you could estimate the identity latent variable, and then generate many additional samples.\n\nPros\n- Very simple and effective disentangling technique for GANs.\n- Great execution, compelling samples on both faces and shoes.\n\nCons\n- Only two factors of variations are disentangled in this model. Could it be generalized to specify more than just two, e.g. lighting, pose, viewpoint, etc?\n- Not much technically new or surprising compared to past work on disentangling generative models.","confidence":"4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Semantically Decomposing the Latent Spaces of Generative Adversarial Networks","abstract":"We propose a new algorithm for training generative adversarial networks to jointly learn latent codes for both identities (e.g. individual humans) and observations (e.g. specific photographs).
