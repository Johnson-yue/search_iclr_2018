Images are tiled and tiles are sampled and encoded into a feature vector via a ResNET-50 pretrained on ImageNET. A 1D convolutional layer followed by a min-max layer and 2 fully connected layer compose the network. The conv layer produces a single value per tile. The min-max layer selects the R min and max values, which then enter the FC layers. A multi-instance (MIL) approach is used to train the model by backpropagating only instances that generate min and max values at the min-max layer. Experiments are run on 2 public datasets achieving potentially top performance. Potentially, because all other methods supposedly make use of segmentation labels of tumor, while this method only uses the whole image label.\n\nPrevious publications have used MIL training on tiles with only top-level labels [1,2] and this is essentially an incremental improvement on the MIL approach by using several instances (both min-negative and max-positive) instead of a single instance for backprop, as described in [3]. So, the main contribution here, is to adapt min-max MIL to the histology domain. Although the result are good and the method interesting, I think that the technical contribution is a bit thin for a ML conference and this paper may be a better fit for a medical imaging conference.\n\nThe paper is well written and easy to understand. \n\n\n\n[1] Hou, L., Samaras, D., Kurc, T.
