Well within the remit of the conference.\nNot much technical novelty to be found, but the original contributions are adequately identified and they are interesting on their own.\n\nMy main concern (and complaint) is not technical, but application-based. This study is (unfortunately) typical in that it focuses on and provides detail of the technical modeling issues, but ignores the medical applicability of the model and results. This is exemplified by the fact that the data set is hardly described at all and the 14 abnormalities/pathologies, the rationale behind their choice and the possible interrelations and dependencies are never described from a medical viewpoint. If I were a medical expert, I would not have a clue about how these results and models could be applied in practice, or about what medical insight I could achieve.\n\nThe bottom line seems to be: \"my model and approach works better than the other guys' model and approach\", but one is left with the impression that these experiments could have been made with other data, other problems, other fields of application and they would not have not changed much ","confidence":"3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Learning to diagnose from scratch by exploiting dependencies among labels","abstract":"The field of medical diagnostics contains a wealth of challenges which closely resemble classical machine learning problems; practical constraints, however, complicate the translation of these endpoints naively into classical architectures.

Clinical settings drive the necessity for high accuracy simultaneously across a multitude of pathological outcomes and greatly limit the utility of tools which consider only a subset.

Experiments are clearly described and results are significantly better compared to state of the art.\n\nThe only issue with this paper is, that their proposed method, in practice is not tractable for inference on estimating probability of a single output, a task which would be critical in medical domain. Considering that their paper is titled as a work to use \"dependencies\" among labels, not being able to evaluate their network's, and lack of interpretable evaluation results on this model in the experiment section is a major limitation. \n\nOn the other hand, there are many alternative models where one could simply use multi-task learning and shared parameter, to predict multiple outcomes extremely efficiently. To be able to claim that this paper improved the prediction by better modeling of 'dependencies' among labels, I would need to see how the (much simpler) multi-task setting works as well. \n\nThat said, the paper has several positive aspects in all areas:\n\nOriginality - the paper presents first combination of DenseNets with LSTM-based output factorization,\nWriting clarity - the paper is very well written and clear.\nQuality - (apart from the missing multi-task baseline), the results are significantly better than state of the art, and experiments are well done,\nSignificance - Apart from the issue of intractable inference which is arguably a large limitation of this work, the application in medical field is significant. \n\n","confidence":"4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Learning to diagnose from scratch by exploiting dependencies among labels","abstract":"The field of medical diagnostics contains a wealth of challenges which closely resemble classical machine learning problems; practical constraints, however, complicate the translation of these endpoints naively into classical architectures.
