The decoding arm of the VAE consists of deep latent Dirichlet allocation, and an upward-downward structure for the encoder. Gamma distributions are approximated as Weibull distributions since the Kullback-Leibler divergence is known and samples can be efficiently drawn from a transformation of samples from a uniform distribution. \n\nThe results in Table 1 are concerning for several reasons, i) the proposed approach underperfroms DLDA-Gibbs and DLDA-TLASGR. ii) The authors point to the scalability of the mini-batch-based algorithms, however, although more expensive, DLDA-Gibbs, is not prohibitive given results for Wikipedia are provided. iii) The proposed approach is certainly faster at test time, however, it is not clear to me in which settings such speed (compared to Gibbs) would be needed, provided the unsupervised nature of the task at hand. iv) It is not clear to me why there is no test-time difference between WAI and WHAI, considering that in the latter, global parameters are sampled via stochastic-gradient MCMC. One possible explanation being that during test time, the approach does not use samples from W but rather a summary of them, say posterior means, in which case, it defeats the purpose of sampling from global parameters, which may explain why WAI and WHAI perform about the same in the 3 datasets considered.\n\n- \\Phi is in a subset of R_+, in fact, columns of \\Phi are in the P_0-dimensional simplex.\n- \\Phi should have K_1 columns not K.\n- The first paragraph in Page 5 is very confusing because h is introduced before explicitly connecting it to k and \\lambda. Also, if k = \\lambda, why introduce different notations?","confidence":"4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"WHAI: Weibull Hybrid Autoencoding Inference for Deep Topic Modeling","abstract":"To train an inference network jointly with a deep generative topic model, making it both scalable to big corpus and fast in out-of-sample prediction, we develop Weibull hybrid autoencoding inference (WHAI) for deep latent Dirichlet allocation (DLDA), which infers posterior samples via a hybrid of stochastic-gradient MCMC and autoencoding variational Bayes.

This is parameterized by a matrix vector product, and the vector in this parameterizeation is itself generated by a vector Gamma with a matrix-vector parameterization. From there the vectors are all Gammas with matrix-vector parameterizations in a typical deep setup.\n\nWhile the model is reasonable, the purpose was not clear to me. If only the last layer generates a document, then what use is the deep structure? For example, learning hierarchical topics as in Figure 4 doesn't seem so useful here since only the last layer matters. Also, since no input is being mapped to an output, what does going deeper mean? It doesn't look like any linear mapping is being learned from the input to output spaces, so ultimately the document itself is coming from a simple linear Poisson model just like LDA and other non-deep methods.\n\nThe experiments are otherwise thorough and convincing that quantitative performance is improved over previous attempts at the problem.","confidence":"2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but it is quite likely that the reviewer did not understand central parts of the paper"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"WHAI: Weibull Hybrid Autoencoding Inference for Deep Topic Modeling","abstract":"To train an inference network jointly with a deep generative topic model, making it both scalable to big corpus and fast in out-of-sample prediction, we develop Weibull hybrid autoencoding inference (WHAI) for deep latent Dirichlet allocation (DLDA), which infers posterior samples via a hybrid of stochastic-gradient MCMC and autoencoding variational Bayes.
