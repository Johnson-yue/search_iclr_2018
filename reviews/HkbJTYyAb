If I understand correctly (please correct me if not) the proposed method is a simplification of Inverse Autoregressive Flow as proposed by Kingma et al. Both of these methods use causal convolution to construct a normalizing flow with tractable Jacobian determinant. The difference is that Kingma et al. used 2d convolution (as well a fully connected architectures) where the authors of this paper propose to use 1d convolution.

Starting from the planar flow proposed in Rezende & Mohammed 2015 using a vector inner product followed by a nonliniarity+element-wise scaling the authors suggests to replace inner product with a shifted 1-D convolution. This reduces the number of parameters used from 2*d to k + d and importantly still maintains the linear time computation of the determinant. This approach feels so straightforward that i’m surprised that it have not been tried before. The authors present results on a synthetic task as well as MNIST and OMNIGLOT. Please find some more detailed comments/questions below\n\n\nQ1) I feel that section 3 could be more detailed about how the convolution normalizing flow relate to normalizing flow, inverse autoregressive flow and the masked-convolution used in real NVP? Especifically a) is it correct that convolutional normalizing flow trades global connectivity for more expressivity locally? b) Can convolutional flow be seen as faster but ´more restricted version of the LSTM implemented inverse autoregressive flow (full lower triangular jacobian vs k off diagonal elements per row in convolutional normalizing flow) \n\nQ2) I miss some more baselines in the experimental section. Did the authors compare the convolutional normalizing flow with e.g. Inverse Autoregressive flow or Auxiliary latent variables? \n\n\nQ3) Albeit the MNIST results seems convincing - and to a lesser degree the OMNIGLOT ones - I miss results on larger natural image benchmark datasets like cifar10 and ImageNet or preferably other modalities like text? Would it be possible to include results on any of these datasets?\n\nOverall i think the idea is nice and potentially useful due to the ease of implementation and speed of convolutional operations. However I think the authors needs to 1) better describe how their method differs from prior work and 2) compare their method to more baselines for the experiments to fully convincing\n","confidence":"4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Convolutional Normalizing Flows","abstract":"Bayesian posterior inference is prevalent in various machine learning problems.

The authors notice an improvement through their method over Normalizing Flows, IWAE with diagonal gaussian approximation, and standard Variational Autoencoders. \nAs noted by AnonReviewer3, several baselines are missing. But the authors partly address that issue in the comment section for the MNIST dataset.\nThe requirement of h being bijective seems wrong. For example, if h was a rectifier nonlinearity in the zero-derivative regime, the Jacobian determinant of the ConvFlow would be 1. \nMore importantly, the main issue is that this paper might need to highlight the fundamental difference between their proposed method and Inverse Autoregressive Flow (Kingma et al., 2016). The proposed connectivity pattern proposed for the convolution in order to make the Jacobian determinant computation is exactly the same as Inverse Autoregressive Flow and the authors seems to be aware of the order dependence of their architecture which is every similar to autoregressive models. This presentation of the paper can be misleading concerning the true innovation in the model trained. Proposing ConvFlow as a type of Inverse Autoregressive Flow would be more accurate and would allow to highlight better the innovation of the work.\nSince this work does not offer additional significant insight over Inverse Autoregressive Flow, its value should be on demonstrating the efficiency of the proposed method. MNIST and Omniglot seems insufficient for that purpose given currently published work.\nIn the current state, I can't recommend the paper for acceptance. \n\n\nDanilo Jimenez Rezende, Shakir Mohamed: Variational Inference with Normalizing Flows.

The results of the methods mentioned in your comment are currently not included in the manuscript, because we would to emphasize that we are NOT putting our focus on optimizing for more sophisticated encoder and decoder architectures as these methods do, but rather on modeling a much richer family of variational posteriors to capture complex distribution of the latent codes on top of a standard encoder network. In fact, we only used  a 2-layer MLP to model the mapping between the input data x to the initial Gaussian latent code z, which is then to be fed into the proposed ConvFlow network to construct complex posteriors. In other words, the proposed method and recent methods, including PixelVAE, PixelCNN, etc, are in orthogonal directions to improve generative modeling and can be potentially combined. \n\nEven with the aforementioned simple encoder and decoder network, our latest experimental results after this submission actually show that we are able to get a NLL of 78.51 with 8 layers of ConvBlock attached on top of the initial Gaussian encoder. This actually surpasses the reported best results of the above methods on statically bainarized MNIST (Deep IAF-VAE: 79.88 and PixelCNN: 79.2) which assumed a much more sophisticated encoder and decoder network (Deep ResNet-like architecture for IAF-VAE and CNN on pixel levels for PixelCNN).\n\nHowever, we fully agree that providing comparisons to those existing methods helps make the paper a complete story. We will update the new results in the revised paper and release the codes to reproduce the above results.
