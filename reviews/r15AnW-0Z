To estimate the ID, the authors apply singular value decomposition to the matrix of activation vectors at each of the layers of the network, in which the intrinsic dimension is determined (in a more or less standard way) by the rank at which two consecutive singular values has a ratio exceeding some threshold. For the convolutional layers of VGG19, they observe that the sum of IDs for each feature map is roughly equal to the ID of the matrix formed by concatenating the vectors over all feature maps. They also observe that the ID drops with each successive layer.\n\nThe authors' findings are intuitively obvious, and certainly not surprising. Although a thorough and careful empirical investigation of this phenomenon would be a welcome addition to the research literature, this paper does not yet reach this standard. First and foremost, a result for a single neural network does not constitute enough evidence to justify the authors' conclusions. Second, the latter half of the paper is concerned with details of the experimental results, without offering any insights as to the implications for deep learning. Third, the paper is not well presented and organized: the introduction is scant; the notational formulism is not at all clear, rigorous, or consistent; the paper overall lacks polish, with many grammatical errors. \n\nOverall, I feel that while this line of research is worthwhile, at this stage the work is not yet ready for publication.","confidence":"4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"THE LOCAL DIMENSION OF DEEP MANIFOLD","abstract":"Based on our observation that there exists a dramatic drop for the singular values of the fully connected layers or a single feature map of the convolutional layer, and that the dimension of the concatenated feature vector almost equals the summation of the dimension on each feature map, we propose a singular value decomposition (SVD) based approach to estimate the dimension of the deep manifolds for a typical convolutional neural network VGG19.
