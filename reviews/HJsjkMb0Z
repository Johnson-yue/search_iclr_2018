The main contribution is to propose a variant of the RevNet architecture that has a built in pseudo-inverse, allowing for easy inversion. The results are very surprising in my view: the proposed architecture is nearly invertible and is able to achieve similar performance as highly competitive variants: ResNets and RevNets.\n\nThe main contribution is to use linear and invertible operators (pixel shuffle) for performing downsampling, instead of non-invertible variants like spatial pooling. While the change is small, conceptually is very important.\n\nCould you please comment on the training time? Although this is not the point of the paper, it would be very informative to include learning curves. Maybe discarding information is not essential for learning (which is surprising), but the cost of not doing so is payed in learning time. Stating this trade-off would be informative. If I understand correctly, the training runs for about 150 epochs, which is maybe double of what the baseline ResNet would require?\n\nThe authors evaluate in Section 4.2 the show samples obtained by the pseudo inverse and study the properties of the representations learned by the model. I find this section really interesting. Further analysis will make the paper stronger.\n\nAre the images used for the interpolation train or test images?\n\nI assume that the network evaluated with the Basel Faces dataset, is the same one trained on Imagenet, is that the case?\n\nIn particular, it would be interesting (not required) to evaluate if the learned representation is able to linearize a variety of geometric image transformations in a controlled setting as done in:\n\nHénaff, O,, and Simoncelli, E. \"Geodesics of learned representations.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:1511.06394 (2015).\n\nCould you please clarify, what do you mean with fine tuning the last layer with dropout?\n\nThe authors should cite the work on learning invertible functions with tractable Jacobian determinant (and exact and tractable log-likelihood evaluation) for generative modeling.

They illustrate empirically that the loss of information can be avoided on large-scale classification such as ImageNet and propose to build an invertible deep network that is capable of retaining the information of the input signal through all the layers of the network until the last layer where the input could be reconstructed.\n\nThe authors demonstrate that progressive contraction and separation of the information can be obtained while at the same time allowing an exact reconstruction of the signal.\n\nAs it requires a special care to design an invertible architecture, the authors architecture is based on the recent reversible residual network (RevNet) introduced in (Gomez et al., 2017) and an invertible down-sampling operator introduced in (Shi et al., 2016). The inverse (classification) path of the network uses the same convolutions as the forward (reconstructing) one. It also uses subtraction operations instead of additions in the output computation in order to reconstruct intermediate and input layers.\n\nTo show the effectiveness of their approach on large-scale classification problem, the authors report top-1 error rates on the validation set of ILSVRC-2012. The obtained result is competitive with the original Resnet and the RevNet models. However, the proposed approach is expensive in terms of parameter budget as it requires almost 6.5 times more parameters than the RevNet and the Resnet architectures. Still, the classification and the reconstructing results are quite impressive as the work is the first empirical evidence that learning invertible representation that preserves information about the input is possible on large-scale classification tasks. Worth noting that recently, (Shwartz-Ziv and Tishby) demonstrated, not on large-scale datasets but on small ones, that an optimal representation for a classification task must reduce as much uninformative variability as possible while maximizing the mutual information between the desired output and its representation in order discriminate as much as possible between classes. This is called “information bottleneck principle”. The submitted paper shows that this principle is not a necessary condition large-scale classification.\n\nThe proposed approach is potentially of great benefit. It is also simple and easy to understand. The paper is well written and the authors position their work with respect to what has been done before. The spectral analysis of the differential operator in section 4.1 provide another motivation for the “hard-constrained” invertible architecture. Section 4.2 illustrates the ability of the network to reconstruct input signals. The visualization obtained suggests that network performs linear separation between complex learned factors. Section 5 shows that even when using either an SVM or a Nearest Neighbor classifier on n extracted features from a layer in the network, both classifiers progressively improve with deeper layers. When the d first principal components are used to summarize the n extracted features, the SVM and NN classifier performs better when d is bigger. This shows that the deeper the network gets, the more linearly separable and contracted the learned representations are.\n\nIn the conclusion, the authors state the following: “The absence of loss of information is surprising, given the wide believe, that discarding information is essential for learning representations that generalize well to unseen data”. Indeed, the authors have succeed in showing that this is not necessarily the case. However, the loss of information might be necessary to generalize well on unseen data and at the same time minimize the parameter budget for a given classification task.\n","confidence":"4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"i-RevNet: Deep Invertible Networks","abstract":"It is widely believed that the success of deep convolutional networks is based on progressively discarding uninformative variability about the input with respect to the problem at hand.
