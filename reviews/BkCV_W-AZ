The paper claims that the approach can deal with the partial observable domain better than the standard methods. However the results only show that the algorithm converges, in some cases, faster than the previous work  reaching asymptotically to a same or worse performance. Whereas one would expect that the algorithm achieve a better asymptotic performance in compare to methods which are designed for fully observable domains and thus performs sub-optimally in the POMDPs. \n\nThe paper dives into the literature of counter-factual regret minimization without providing much intuition on why this type of ideas should provide improvement in the case of partial observable domain. To me it is not clear at all why this idea should help in the partial observable domains beside the argument that this method is designed in the game-theoretic settings   which makes no Markov assumption . The way that I interpret this algorithm is that by adding A+ to the return the algorithm  introduces some bias for actions which are likely to be optimal so it is in some sense implements the optimism in the face of uncertainty principle. This may explains why this algorithm converges faster than the baseline as it produces better exploration strategy. To me it is not clear that the boost comes from the fact that the algorithm deals with partial observability more efficiently.\n\n\nOriginality and Significance:\n\nThe proposed algorithm seems original. However,  as it is acknowledged by the authors this type of optimistic policy gradient algorithms have been previously used in RL (though maybe not with the game theoretic justification). I believe the algorithm introduced  in this paper, if it is presented well, can be  an interesting addition to the literature of Deep RL, e.g.,  in terms of improving the rate of convergence. However, the current version of paper  does not provide conclusive evidence for that as in most of the domains the algorithm only converge marginally faster than the standard ones. Given the fact that algorithms like dueling DQN and DDPG are   for the best asymptotic results and not  for the best convergence rate, this improvement  can be due to the choice of hyper parameter such as step size or epsilon decay scheduling. More experiments over a range of hyper parameter is needed before one can conclude that this algorithm improves the rate of convergence.\n ","confidence":"5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Regret Minimization for Partially Observable Deep Reinforcement Learning","abstract":"Deep reinforcement learning algorithms that estimate state and state-action value functions have been shown to be effective in a variety of challenging domains, including learning control strategies from raw image pixels.

Specifically, the authors introduce an algorithm called ARM which can deal with partial observability better. The results is interesting and novel. This paper should be accepted.\n\nThe presentation of the paper can be improved a bit. Much of the notation introduced in section 3.1 is not used later on. There seems to be a bit of a disconnect before and after section 3.3. The algorithm in deep RL could be explained a bit better.\n\nThere are some papers that could be connected. Notably the distributional RL work that was recently published could be very interesting to compare against in partially observed environments.\n\nIt could also be interesting if the authors were to run the proposed algorithm on environments where long-term memory is required to achieve the goals.\n\nThe argument the authors made against recurrent value functions is that recurrent value could be hard to train. An experiment illustrating this effect could be illuminating.\n\nCan the proposed approach help when we have recurrent value functions? Since recurrence does not guarantee that all information needed is captured.\n\n\nFinally some miscellaneous points:\n\nOne interesting reference: Memory-based control with recurrent neural\nnetworks by Heess et al.\n\nPotential typos: in the 4th bullet point in section 3.1, should it be \\rho^{\\pi}(h, s')?","confidence":"4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Regret Minimization for Partially Observable Deep Reinforcement Learning","abstract":"Deep reinforcement learning algorithms that estimate state and state-action value functions have been shown to be effective in a variety of challenging domains, including learning control strategies from raw image pixels.

Yes A3C and TRPO seem like they perform very poorly compared to ARM... but I'm left wondering how/why?\n\nI feel like this paper is in a difficult position of trying to cover a lot of material/experiments in too short a paper.\nA lot of the cited literature was also new to me, so it could be that I'm missing something about why this is so interesting.\nHowever, I came away from this paper quite uncertain about the real benefits/differences of ARM versus other similar policy gradient methods... I also didn't feel the experimental evaluations drove a clear message except \"ARM did better than all other methods on these experiments\"... I'd want to understand how/why and whether we should expect this universally.\nThe focus on \"regret minimization perspectives\" didn't really get me too excited...\n\nOverall I would vote against acceptance for this version.\n","confidence":"4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Regret Minimization for Partially Observable Deep Reinforcement Learning","abstract":"Deep reinforcement learning algorithms that estimate state and state-action value functions have been shown to be effective in a variety of challenging domains, including learning control strategies from raw image pixels.
