The improvement is really tiny and a statistical test (not included in the analysis) probably wouldn't pass a significant threshold.  This analysis is missing a straw man. It is not clear whether the difference in the evaluation measures is related to the greater number of examples or by the specific generative model.\nConcerning the contribution of the model, one novelty is the conditional formulation of the discriminator. The design of the empirical evaluation doesn't address the analysis of the impact of this new formulation. It is not clear whether the supposed improvement is related to the conditional formulation. \nFigure 3 and Figure 5 illustrate the brain maps generated for Collection 1952 with ICW-GAN and for collection 503 with ACD-GAN. It is not clear how the authors operated the choices of these figures. From the perspective of neuroscience a reader,  would expect to look at the brain maps for the same collection with different methods. The pairwise brain maps would support the interpretation of the generated data. It is worthwhile to remember that the location of brain activations is crucial to detect whether the brain decoding (classification) relies on artifacts or confounds.\n\nMinor comments\n- typos: \"a first application or this\" => \"a first application of this\" (p.2)\n- \"qualitative quality\" (p.2)","confidence":"3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"HALLUCINATING BRAINS WITH ARTIFICIAL BRAINS","abstract":"Human brain function as measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging\n(fMRI), exhibits a rich diversity.

As a\nconsequence results on decoding learning task using low resolution\nimages can end up worse than with the actual data (as pointed out).\nWhat it means is that the actual impact of the work is probably limited.\n\n- Generating high resolution images with GANs even on faces for which\nthere is almost infinite data is still a challenge. Here a few thousand\ndata points are used. So it raises too concerns: First is it enough?\nUsing so-called learning curves is a good way to answer this. Second\nis what are the contributions to the state-of-the-art of the 2\nmethods introduced?
