Clear reject.","rating":"3: Clear rejection","review":"The paper presents a model-based imitation learning framework which learns the state transition distribution of the expert. A model-based policy is learned that should matches the expert transition dynamics. The approach can be used for imitation learning when the actions of the expert are not observed, but only the state transitions (which is an important special case).  \n\nPros:\n- The paper concentrates on an interesting special case of imitation learning\n\nCons:\n- The paper is written very confusingly and hard to understand. The algorithm needs to be better motivated and explained and the paper needs proof reading.\n- The algorithm is based on many heuristics that are not well motivated. \n- The algorithm is only optimizing the one step error function for imitation learning but not the long term behavior. It heavily relies on the learned transition dynamics of the expert p(s_t+1|s_t). This transition model will be wrong if we go away from the expert's trajectories. Hence, I do not see why we should use p(s_t+1|s_t) to define the reward function. It does not prevent the single step \nerrors of the policy to accumulate (which is the main goal of inverse reinforcement learning)\n- The results are not convincing\n- Other algorithms (such as GAIL) could be used in the same setup (no action observations). Comparisons to other imitation learning approaches are needed.\n\nIn summary, this is a poorly written paper that seems to rely on a lot of heuristics that are not well motivated. Also the results are not convincing. Clear reject.\n\n\nMore detailed comments\n- It is unclear why a model-based and model-free policy need to be used. Is the model-based policy used at any time in the algorithm? If it is just used as final result, why train it iteratively? Why can we not just also use the model-based policy for data collection?\n- It is unclear why the heuristic reward function makes sense. First of all, the defined reward is stochastic as \\hat{s}_t+1 is a sample from the next state from the expert's transition model. Why do not we use the mean of the transition model here, then it would not be stochastic any more. Second, a much simpler reward could be used that essentially does the same thing. Instead of requiring a learned dynamics model f_E for predicting the next state, we can just use the experienced next state s_t+1. Note that the reward function for time step t can depend on s_t+1 in an MDP.  \n- The objective that is optimized (Eq. 4) is not well defined. A function is not an objective function if we can only optimize part of it for theta while keeping theta fixed for the other part. It is unclear which objective the real algorithm optimizes\n- There are quite a few confusions in terms of notation. Sometimes, a stochastic transition model p(s_t+1|s_t, a_t) is used and sometimes a deterministic model f_E(s,a). It is unclear how they relate. \n- Many other imitation learning techniques could be used in this setup including max-entropy inverse RL [1], IRL by distribution matching [2] and the approach given in [3] and GAIL. A comparison to at least a subset of these methods is needed\n\n[1] B. Ziebart et al, Maximum Entropy Inverse Reinforcement Learning, AAAI 2008\n[2] Arenz, O.; Abdulsamad, H.; Neumann, G. (2016).

If so, this would be useful to know.\n\nThere are minor grammatical mistakes that can be corrected.\n\nAfter equation 5, the authors suggest categorical loss for discrete problems, \nbut cross-entropy loss might work better. Maybe this is what they meant.\n\n\nCLARITY\n\nThe overall approach and algorithms are described fairly clearly. Some minor typos here and there.\n\nAlgorithm 1 does not make clear the relationship between the model learned in step 2 and the algorithms in steps 4 to 6.\n\nI would reverse the order of a few things to align with a right to left ordering principle. \nIn Figure 1, put the model free transition generator on the left and the model-based sample consumer on the right.\nIn Figure 3, put the “reacher” test on the left and the “flappy bird” on the right.\n\n\nPROS AND CONS\n\nInteresting idea for learning quickly from small numbers of samples of expert state trajectories. \n\nNot clear that method converges on all problems. \n\nNot clear that the method is able to extract the state from video — authors had to extract position manually\n(this point is more about their deep architecture than the imitation framework they describe -\nthough perhaps a key argument for the authors is the ability to work with small numbers of \nexpert samples and still be able to train deep methods ) ??\n\n\n","confidence":"3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"Model-based imitation learning from state trajectories","abstract":"Imitation learning from demonstrations usually relies on learning a policy from trajectories of optimal states and actions.
