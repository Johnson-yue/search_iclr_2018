With context, speaker ID, previous output, and buffer, the new buffer representation is created with a shallow fully connected neural network and inserted into the buffer memory. Then the output is created by buffer and speaker ID with another fully connected neural network. A novel speaker can be adapted just by fitting it with SGD while fixing all other components.\n\nIn experiments, authors try single-speaker TTS and multi-speaker TTS along with speaker identification (ID), and show that the proposed approach outperforms baselines, namely, Tacotron and Char2wav. Finally, they use the challenging Youtube data to train the model and show promising results.\n\nI like the idea in the paper but it has some limitations as described below:\n\nPros:\n1. It uses relatively simple and less number of parameters by using shallow fully-connected neural networks. \n2. Using shifting buffer memory looks interesting and novel.\n3. The proposed approach outperforms baselines in several tasks, and the ability to fit to a novel speaker is nice. But there are some issues as well (see Cons.)\n\nCons:\n1. Writing is okay but could be improved. Some notations were not clearly described in the text even though it was in the table. \n2. Baselines. The paper says Deep Voice 2 (Arik et al., 2017a) is only prior work for multi-speaker TTS. However, it was not compared to. Also for multi-speaker TTS, in (Arik et al., 2017a), Tacotron (Wang et al., 2017) was used as a baseline but in this paper only Char2wav was employed as a baseline. Also for Youtube dataset, it would be great if some baselines were compared with like  (Arik et al., 2017a).\n\n\nDetailed comment:\n1. To demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed model, it would be great to have the numbers of parameters for the proposed model and baseline models.\n2. I was not so clear about how to fit a new speaker and adding more detail would be good.\n3. Why do you think your model is better than VCTK test split, and even VCTK85 is better than VCTK101?","confidence":"4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"VoiceLoop: Voice Fitting and Synthesis via a Phonological Loop","abstract":"We present a new neural text to speech (TTS) method that is able to transform text to speech in voices that are sampled in the wild.

This is a relevant problem, and a novel solution, but synthesis is a wicked problem to evaluate, so I am not sure if ICLR is the best venue for this paper. I see two competing goals:\n\n- If the focus is on showing that the presented approach outperforms other approaches under given conditions, a different task would be better (for example recognition, or some sort of trajectory reconstruction)\n- If the focus is on showing that the system outperforms other synthesis systems, then a speech oriented venue might be best (and it is unfortunate that optimized hyper-parameters for the other systems are not available for a fair comparsion)\n- If fair comparisons with the other appraoches cannot be made, my sense is that the multi-speaker (post-training fitting) option is really the most interesting and novel contribution here, which could be discussed in mroe detail\n\nStill, the approach is creative and interesting and deserves to be presented. I have a few questions/ suggestions:\n\nIntroduction\n\n- The link to Baddeley's \"phonological loop\" concept seems weak at best. There is nothing phonological about the features that this model stores and retrieves, and no evidence that the model behaves in a way consistent with \"phonologcial\" (or articulatory) assumptions or models - maybe best to avoid distracting the reader with this concept and strengthen the speaker adaptation aspect?\n- The memory model is not an RNN, but it is a recurrently called structure (as the name \"phonological loop\" also implies) - so I would also not highlight this point much\n- Why would the four properties of the proposed method (mid of p. 2, end of introduction: memory buffer, shared memory, shallow fully connected networks, and simple reader mechanism) lead to better robustness and improve performance on noisy and limited training data? Maybe the proposed approach works better for any speech synthesis task? Why specifically for \"in-the-wild\" data? The results in Table 2 show that the proposed system outperforms other systems on Blizzard 2013, but not Blizzard 2011 - does this support the previous argument?\n- Why not also evaluate MCD scores? This should be a quick and automatic way to diagnose what the system is doing? Or is this not meaningful with the noisy training data?\n\nPrevious work\n\n- Please introduce abbreviations the first time they are used (\"CBHG\" for example)\n- There is other work on using \"in-the-wild\" speech as well: Pallavi Baljekar and Alan W Black. Utterance Selection Techniques for TTS Systems using Found Speech, SSW 2016, Sunnyvale, USA Sept 2016\n\nThe architecture\n- Please explain the \"GMM\" (Gaussian Mixture Model?) attention mechanism in a bit more detail, how does back-propagation work in this case?\n- Why was this approach chosen? Does it promise to be robust or good for low data situations specifically?\n- The fonts in Figure 2 are very small, please make them bigger, and the Figure may not print well in b/w. Why does the mean of the absolute weights go up for high buffer positions? Is there some \"leaking\" from even longer contexts?\n- I don't understand \"However, human speech is not deterministic and one cannot expect [...] truth\". You are saying that the model cannot be excepted to reproduce the input exactly? Or does this apply only to the temporal distribution of the sequence (but not the spectral characteristics)? The previous sentence implies that it does. And how does teacher-forcing help in this case?\n- what type of speed is \"x5\"? Five times slower or faster than real-time?\n\nExperiments\n- Table 2: maybe mention how these results were computed, i.e. which systems use optimized hyper parameters, and which don't? How do these results support the interpretation of hte results in the introruction re in-the-wild data and found data?\n- I am not sure how to read Figure 4. Maybe it would be easier to plot the different phone sequences against each other and show how the timings are off, i.e. plot the time of the center of panel one vs the time of the center of panel 2 for the corresponding phone, and show how this is different from a straight line. Or maybe plot phones as rectangles that get deformed from square shape as durations get learned?\n- Figure 5: maybe provide spectrograms and add pitch contours to better show the effect of the dfifferent intonations? \n- Figure 4 uses a lot of space, could be reduced, if needed\n\nDiscussion\n- I think the first claim is a bit to broad - nowhere is it shown that the method is inherently more robust to clapping and laughs, and variable prosody. The authors will know the relevant data-sets better than I do, maybe they can simply extend the discussion to show that this is what happens. \n- Efficiency: I think Wavenet has also gotten much faster and runs in less than real-time now - can you expand that discussion a bit, or maybe give estimates in times of FLOPS required, rather than anecdotal evidence for systems that may or may not be comparable?\n\nConclusion\n- Now the advantage of the proposed model is with the number of parameters, rather than the computation required. Can you clarify? Are your models smaller than competing models?\n","confidence":"4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct"},"writers":[],"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"VoiceLoop: Voice Fitting and Synthesis via a Phonological Loop","abstract":"We present a new neural text to speech (TTS) method that is able to transform text to speech in voices that are sampled in the wild.

The proposed memory model is indeed a network with recurrence and, therefore, it is a Recurrent Neural Network. We meant to highlight the differences from conventional and other existing RNN models. We will clarify this point.\n\n2. In our experiments, buffer sizes between 15 and 30 seem to produce similar results. Less than 15 is detrimental. See also Fig. 2, which depicts the relative contribution of each column of the buffer and shows that all columns impact the computations done for the attention, the output, and the buffer update.\n\n3. We have not tested the specific experiment that is described but have done a similar experiment in which we train on voices of north Americans and fit on other accents. The results confirm that when fitting out of distribution voices, the quality degrades. However, the fitting is still successful in capturing the pitch and other aspects of the voice. \n\nThe authors."},"nonreaders":[],"replyCount":0,"writable":false,"revisions":false,"tags":[],"forumContent":{"title":"VoiceLoop: Voice Fitting and Synthesis via a Phonological Loop","abstract":"We present a new neural text to speech (TTS) method that is able to transform text to speech in voices that are sampled in the wild.
